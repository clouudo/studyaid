manage and control the numerous corrections, extensions, and adaptations that are applied to a system over its lifetime.\n*   It handles the control of all product items and changes to those items.\n*   **SCM applied to software products includes:** documents, executable software, source code, hardware, and disks.\n*   **Definition:** The discipline of identifying the configuration of a system at discrete points in time for the purpose of systematically controlling changes to this configuration and maintaining the integrity and traceability of this configuration throughout the system life cycle.\n*   **Purpose of SCM:**\n    *   Ensures that development processes are traceable and systematic so that all changes are precisely managed.\n    *   Consequently, the product is always in a well-defined state.\n    *   Enhances the quality of the delivered system and the productivity of the maintainers.\n\n### 3.2 Objectives of SCM\n\n*   Uniquely identify every version of every software at various points in time.\n*   Retain past versions of documentations and software.\n*   Provide a trail of audit for all modifications performed.\n*   Throughout the software lifecycle, maintain the traceability and integrity of system changes.\n\n### 3.3 Benefits of SCM\n\n#### 3.3.1 General Benefits\n\n*   Confusion is reduced and order is established.\n*   Allows you to evaluate, approve, and implement changes into a configuration item in SCM.\n*   To maintain product integrity, the necessary activities are organized.\n*   Correct product configurations are ensured.\n*   Quality is ensured and better quality software consumes less maintenance efforts.\n\n#### 3.3.2 Enhanced Benefits\n\n*   Productivity is improved, because analysts and programmers know exactly where to find any piece of

(1321, 2000000060, '*   Allows you to evaluate, approve, and implement changes into a configuration item in SCM.\n*   To maintain product integrity, the necessary activities are organized.\n*   Correct product configurations are ensured.\n*   Quality is ensured and better quality software consumes less maintenance efforts.\n\n#### 3.3.2 Enhanced Benefits\n\n*   Productivity is improved, because analysts and programmers know exactly where to find any piece of the software.\n*   Liability is reduced by documenting the trail of actions.\n*   Cost savings are realized across the product development life cycle.\n*   Maintaining product integrity through defined, tracked, and audited CIs ensures that the product released to customers has a well-managed bill of materials.\n*   Conformance with requirements is enabled.\n*   A reliable working environment is provided.\n*   Compliance with standards is enhanced.\n*   Accounting of status is enhanced.\n\n### 3.4 Four Elements of CM\n\n1.  **Identification of software configurations:** This includes the definitions of the different artifacts, their baselines or milestones, and the changes to the artifacts.\n2.  **Control of software configurations:** This element is about controlling the ways artifacts or configurations are altered with the necessary technical and administrative support.\n3.  **Auditing software configurations:** This element is about making the current status of the software system in its lifecycle visible to management and determining whether or not the baselines meet their

(1323, 2000000060, '*   The requirement for aggregate artifacts develops so that maintenance employees can use linkages between artifacts and attributes to guarantee consistency in large projects.\n*   Models that support the concept of software configurations are used to capture relationships between artifacts and attributes.\n*   A configuration, by definition, is a collection of versionable elements. The concept of configuration increases the necessity for users to be able to access sections and versions of aggregated artifacts selectively.\n\n#### 3.5.4 Work Space Control\n\n*   SCM systems use work areas to provide users with a private location. Users undertake the standard responsibilities of editing and maintaining their objects in their own workspaces.\n*   The workspace is the environment that allows the maintainer to make and test changes in a controlled environment.\n*   Workspaces can be realized in two ways:\n    *   As basic as the programmer\'s home directory while modifying files.\n    *   As a more complex system like an integrated development environment and a database.\n\n#### 3.5.5 Three Basic Functions in Workspace\n\n1.  **Sandbox:** Checked-out files are placed in a workspace where they can be freely changed. The original files in the repository do not need to be locked.\n2.  **Building:** To save space, an SCM system usually saves the differences between subsequent versions. As a result, the workspace converts the deltas into entire source files. The workspace also contains the derived binaries. SCM keeps track of source code (file) modifications (commits) and the revision history of each commit.

(1324, 2000000060, 'The workspace also contains the derived binaries. SCM keeps track of source code (file) modifications (commits) and the revision history of each commit. Commits are compressed and will be enlarged (uncompressed/extracted) when modifications are required. There are two types of repositories: a single repository and a distributed repository.\n3.  **Isolation:** Each programmer has at least one workspace. As a result, the developer modifies the source code, compiles the files, tests the code, and debugs it without interfering with the work of other developers.\n\n#### 3.5.6 Building\n\n*   Efficiency is a key requirement of SCM systems so that developers can quickly build an executable file from the versioned source files.\n*   SCM systems must enable the building of old versions of the system for recovery, testing, maintenance, or additional release purposes.\n*   Most SCM systems support building of software.\n*   The build process and their products are assessed for quality assurance.\n*   Outputs of the build process become quality assurance records, and these records may be needed for future reference.\n\n#### 3.5.7 Change Management\n\n*   SCM systems must:\n    *   Enable users to understand the impact of modifications.\n    *   Enable users to identify the products to which a specific modification applies.\n    *   Provide maintenance personnel with tools for change management so that all activities from specifying requirements to coding can be traced.\n\n#### 3.5.8 Status Accounting\n\n*   To quantify the properties of the software being developed and the process being used, it is necessary to gather statistics at the SCM level.\n*   The primary purpose of status accounting is to:\n    *   Keep formal records of already existing configurations.\n    *   Produce

Only a few instances have code, data, and documentation.\n*   After configuration items have been identified, a software baseline library is constructed to make the list of changeable items publicly available.\n*   The library, also known as the repository, is at the heart of the SCM system.\n*   All public configurations are saved in the repository, which is a central location.\n*   The

(1327, 2000000060, 'ne of the key features offered by SCM tools is version control.\n*   These tools utilize an archiving method to save every change made to a file, allowing users to revert to a previous version if any issues arise. (Mentor, 2023)\n\n#### 3.7.2 Synchronization\n\n*   Another essential feature of SCM tools is synchronization.\n*   This allows users to check out multiple files or even a complete repository.\n*   After working on the necessary files, users can commit their changes back to the repository.\n*   Additionally, they can periodically update their local copies to reflect changes made by other team members, which is referred to as synchronization. (Mentor, 2023)\n\n#### 3.7.3 Concurrency Management\n\n*   Concurrency refers to the occurrence of multiple tasks simultaneously.\n*   In the context of SCM, it refers to different individuals editing the same file at the same time.\n*   If concurrency is not effectively managed with SCM tools, it can lead to significant issues. (Mentor, 2023)\n\n#### 3.7.4 Automation\n\n*   SCM tools decisively automate critical tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software.\n*   This automation significantly reduces manual effort, boosts efficiency, and minimizes errors.\n*   Examples of effective tools include Jenkins and TeamCity for build automation, while Ansible and Chef excel in automated deployments.\n\n#### 3.7.5 Dependency Mapping\n\n*   These tools effectively visualize and manage the relationships between different configuration items and services.\n*   This capability is essential for understanding the impact of changes and maintaining system health.\n\n### 3.8 SCM Tools – Examples\n\n*   Docker\n*   SolarWinds\n*   Octopus Deploy\n*   PowerShell\n*   ConfigHub\n\n### 3.9 References\n\n*   Blokdyk.

As a result, all changes must be compatible with the existing software architecture, design, and code limitations.\n\n#### Shorter Time Frame\n\nMaintenance activities might last anywhere from a few hours to many months, but software creation can take up to a year.\n\n#### Available Test Data\n\nTest cases are created from scratch during software development, however software maintenance can choose a portion of these test cases and run them as regression tests. As a result, selecting acceptable test cases from the existing test suite is a hurdle. To effectively test the code changes, in addition to the regression test cases, new test cases must be written.\n\n### Intention-Based Classification\n\nAccording to ISO/IEC 14764, the categories of software maintenance are:\n\n*   Corrective\n*   Adaptive\n*   Perfective\n*   Preventive\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n#### Corrective Maintenance\n\nReact to problems that are uncovered.

(2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n### Documentation\n\n#### Reformative\n\nOrdinary actions of this sort include improving the readability of the documentation, aligning it with other system modifications, creating training materials, and adding entries to a data dictionary.\n\n#### Updative\n\nTypical tasks include replacing out-of-date documentation with current documentation, creating semi-formal documentation, such as in UML, to document current programme code, and updating the documentation with test plans.\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n### Software Properties\n\n#### Groomative\n\nSubstituting more efficient and simpler components and algorithms, updating data naming standards, changing access authorizations, compiling source code, and performing backups are all common actions in this category.\nOrdinary preventive efforts of this type make improvements to improve maintainability and lay the groundwork for a future transition to an emerging technology.\nPerformance activities provide results that have an influence on the user. These operations increase system uptime by replacing slower components and algorithms.\nOrdinary adaptive actions of this sort migrate software to a new execution platform and increase the use of COTS components.\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K.

(1335, 2000000061, '### Issues and Challenges in Software Maintenance\n\n#### Costs\n\nSoftware maintenance is a big part of the overall development process, consuming between 60% and 80% of total costs. Most of these expenses come from making enhancements or updates to the software rather than fixing errors.\n\n#### Impact Analysis\n\nOne major challenge in maintaining software is understanding how changes will affect the rest of the system. Impact analysis helps assess the possible outcomes of a modification, aiming to minimize unexpected problems. This process includes checking if the proposed change is correct, evaluating risks, and estimating how it will impact system performance and development.\n\n(Gupta et al., n.d.)\n\n#### Corrective Changes\n\nCorrective changes can be tricky because it\'s often hard to identify where exactly changes need to be made in the code. Recognizing the relevant parts of the codebase can be difficult. Even small modifications might require significant changes to the software\'s structure, which can be time-consuming. If a workaround has already been implemented for a problem, fixing new issues can become even more complicated. Repairing design flaws is challenging since it requires a deep understanding of the entire codebase and comes with risks.\n\n#### Adaptive Changes\n\nAdaptive changes, which involve updating the software to work with new technologies, can also be hard. Sometimes, there\'s not enough information about what the software needs to change to. Understanding new technologies and how to integrate them can be difficult. Additionally, issues may arise from a lack of proper initial design.\n\n#### Program Comprehension\n\nProgram comprehension is another important aspect. Maintenance engineers often spend a lot of time reading and understanding the code and documentation to grasp the logic, purpose, and structure of the software.

Springer Vieweg.\n\n#### Quick Fix Model\n\n*   Necessary changes are quickly made to the code and then to the accompanying documentation.\n*   The new code is recompiled to produce a new version.\n*   Embodies a commonly used approach to software maintenance.\n*   Low cost.\n*   Less concern on the impacts of modifications.\n\nSource: http://www.professionalqa.com/software-maintenance-models\n\n#### Iterative Enhancement Model\n\n*   Based on the Japanese concept of Kaizen, which stands for the gradual and systematic enhancement of procedures.\n*   First changes are made to the highest level documents.\n*   Eventually, changes are propagated down to the code level.\n*   Assumes complete documentation is available.\n*   It begins with the existing system’s artifacts, namely, requirements, design, code, test, and analysis documents.\n*   It revises the highest-level documents affected by the changes and propagates the changes down through the lower-level documents.\n*   The model allows maintainers to redesign the system, based on the analysis of the existing system.\n*   Also accommodates the quick fix model.\n\nSource:

(2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n**Full reuse comprises two major steps:**\n\n1.  Perform requirement analysis and design of the new system.\n2.  Use the appropriate artifacts, such as requirements, design, code, and test from any earlier versions of the old system.\n\n**The following activities are performed:**\n\n*   Identify the components of the old system that are candidates for reuse.\n*   Understand the identified system components.\n*   Modify the old system components to support the new requirements.\n*   Integrate the modified components to form the newly developed system.\n\nSource: Tripathy, P., Naik K.

following:\n*   Identify strategies for disaster planning, including recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) based on business requirements.\n*   Identify disaster planning for Amazon Web Services (AWS) service categories.\n*   Describe common patterns for backup and disaster recovery (DR) and how to implement them.\n*   Use the AWS Well-Architected Framework principles when designing a disaster recovery plan.\n\n### 1.2 Module Overview\n#### Presentation Sections\n*   Disaster planning strategies\n*   AWS disaster recovery planning\n*   Disaster recovery patterns\n*   Applying AWS Well-Architected Framework principles to disaster planning\n\n#### Knowledge Checks\n*   10-question knowledge check\n*   Sample exam question\n\n### 1.3 Hands-on Labs in this Module\n#### Guided Lab\n*   Configuring Hybrid Storage and Migrating Data with AWS Storage Gateway S3 File Gateway\n\n### 1.4 Role of a Cloud Architect in Disaster Planning\nAs a cloud architect planning for disasters:\n*   I need to design architectures that mitigate the risk of disaster, and also support timely recovery from disasters when they occur, so that I can help to minimize the impact of disasters on the business.\n*   I need to consider the organization\'s business needs so I can apply disaster recovery patterns that balance cost, data loss, and recovery time.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 2: Disaster Planning Strategies\n\n### 2.1 Planning for Disaster\nFailures can occur at any scale:\n*   **Small-scale events:** A server stops responding.\n*   **Large-scale events:** Multiple

(1343, 2000000062, 'ures can occur at any scale:\n*   **Small-scale events:** A server stops responding.\n*   **Large-scale events:** Multiple resources across an Availability Zone are unavailable.\n*   **Global events:** Failure is widespread and impacts a large number of users and systems.\n\n### 2.2 Avoiding and Planning for Disaster\n*   **Fault tolerance:** Minimize how often your applications and data become unavailable.\n*   **Backup:** Make sure you have a backup plan for handling data in case of a disaster.\n*   **Disaster recovery:** Recover your data and get your applications back online after a disaster.\n\n### 2.3 Factors Influencing Disaster Planning Strategies\n*   **Time dependency:** How quickly does this need to be remedied to avoid business impact?\n*   **Data loss:** What is the amount of data you are OK with losing? What is the type of data you are OK with losing?\n*   **Geographic location:** Does this impact multiple AWS Regions? Do different Regions require different measurements of how quickly they must recover and how much data loss is OK?\n*   **Cost:** Does the cost represent the correct level considering business impact and risk?\n\n### 2.4 Determining RPO (Recovery Point Objective)\nRPO is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time.\nHow often must your data be backed up?\n*   **Example:** Determine that a loss of a maximum of 800 records is acceptable for your application. Use existing patterns to determine that no more than 100 records are created an hour. Calculate that an RPO of 8 hours (8 * 100 records) is acceptable.

Based on this information, if a disaster occurred at 10 p.m., the system should be able to recover all data that was in the system before 2 p.m.\n\n### 2.5 Determining RTO (Recovery Time Objective)\nRTO is the maximum acceptable amount of time after a disaster strikes that a business process can remain out of commission.\nHow quickly must your applications and data be recovered?\n*   **Example:** Determine that a ticketing service for a local music venue can be restored within 2 hours. The business calculates that after 2 hours of an outage, it will begin to lose revenue from lost sales. Calculate that an RTO of 2 hours is acceptable. Based on this information, if a disaster occurred at 9 p.m., the system should be returned to service before 11 p.m.\n\n### 2.6 Preparing a BCP (Business Continuity Plan)\nA business continuity plan (BCP) is a system of prevention and recovery from potential threats to a company.\nA BCP consists of the following:\n*   Business impact analysis\n*   Risk assessment\n*   Disaster recovery plan\n*   Evaluated and determined RPO and RTO\n\n### 2.7 Key Takeaways: Disaster Planning Strategies\n*   Failures can occur at any time and on a small, large, or global scale.\n*   A disaster recovery plan will help limit business and customer impact when a disaster occurs.\n*   RPO is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss after an unplanned data-loss incident.\n*   RTO is the amount of time an application, system, and process can be down without causing significant damage to the business.\n*   A BCP is a system of prevention and recovery from potential threats to a company that includes RPO

Provides basic failover between endpoints or S3 websites.\n*   **ELB (Elastic Load Balancing):** Provides traffic distribution. Makes disaster recovery implementation straightforward.\n*   **Amazon VPN:** Provides secure access to your on-premises network resources from your Amazon VPC through a VPN connection.\n*   **AWS Direct Connect:** Provides the dedicated network connection for fast, consistent data transfer between on-premises and AWS.\n\n### 3.9 Supporting Database Recovery\n*   **Amazon RDS:** Save a snapshot in a separate Region. Use read replicas and Multi-AZ deployments. Retain automated backups.\n*   **DynamoDB:** Back up entire tables. Use point-in-time-recovery to restore tables. Create backups. Use global tables to build a multi-Region, multi-active database.\n\n### 3.10 Replicating and Redeploying Environments\n*   **CloudFormation:** Use templates to quickly deploy collections of resources as needed. Duplicate production environments in a new Region or virtual private cloud (VPC) in minutes.\n*   **OpsWorks:** Manage and deploy applications across fleets.\n\n### 3.11 Key Takeaways: AWS Disaster Recovery Planning\n*   Use features such as CRR, EBS volume snapshots, and Amazon RDS snapshots to protect data.\n*   Use networking features, such as Route 53 failover and ELB, to improve application availability.\n*   Use automation services, such as CloudFormation, as part of your DR strategy to quickly deploy duplicate environments when needed.\n*   Use EventBridge to use global endpoints to

Create and maintain Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) of key servers where fast recovery is needed. Regularly run, test, and update these servers.\n*   **In case of disaster:** Bring up resources around the replicated core dataset. Then scale the system as needed to handle current production traffic. Switch over to the new system.\n\n### 4.7 Warm Standby Pattern\n*   **AWS Cloud:** Secondary DB, Auto scaling group (Web servers, App servers)\n*   **On-premises or AWS Cloud:** Primary DB\n*   **Connectivity/Routing:** Route 53 hosted zone, www.example.com\n*   **Failover:** Primary, Secondary Region, Low capacity, Web server, App servers, Data replication\n\n### 4.8 Implementing Warm Standby Pattern\n*   **Preparation phase:** Similar to pilot light. Has all necessary components running 24/7, but not scaled for production traffic. Need to conduct continuous testing on components.\n*   **In case of disaster:** Failover most critical production load immediately. Scale the system further to handle all production load (automatically).\n\n### 4.9 Multi-site Pattern\n*   **AWS Cloud:** Secondary DB, Auto scaling group (Web servers, App servers)\n*   **On-premises or AWS Cloud:** Primary DB\n*   **Connectivity/Routing:** Route 53 hosted zone, www.example.com\n*   **Failover:** Primary, Secondary Region, Full capacity always running, Web servers, App servers, Data replication\n\n### 4.10 Implementing Multi-site Pattern\n*   **Preparation phase:** Similar to warm standby.

However, it has the highest RTO.\n*   Multi-site provides the fastest RTO. However, it costs the most because it provides a fully running production-ready duplicate.\n*   Storage Gateway provides three interfaces—File Gateway, Volume Gateway, and Tape Gateway—for data backup and recovery between on-premises and the AWS Cloud.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 5: Guided Lab: Configuring Hybrid Storage and Migrating Data with AWS Storage Gateway S3 File Gateway\n\n### 5.1 AWS Storage Gateway Lab Tasks\nIn this lab, you perform the following main tasks:\n*   Configure an S3 File Gateway with an NFS file share and attach it to a Linux instance.\n*   Migrate a set of data from the

The concept of configuration increases the necessity for users to be able to access sections and versions of aggregated artifacts selectively.\n\n#### 3.5.4 Work Space Control\n\n*   SCM systems use work areas to provide users with a private location. Users undertake the standard responsibilities of editing and maintaining their objects in their own workspaces.\n*   The workspace is the environment that allows the maintainer to make and test changes in a controlled environment.\n*   Workspaces can be realized in two ways:\n    *   As basic as the programmer\'s home directory while modifying files.\n    *   As a more complex system like an integrated development environment and a database.\n\n#### 3.5.5 Three Basic Functions in Workspace\n\n1.  **Sandbox:** Checked-out files are placed in a workspace where they can be freely changed. The original files in the repository do not need to be locked.\n2.  **Building:** To save space, an SCM system usually saves the differences between subsequent versions. As a result, the workspace converts the deltas into entire source files. The workspace also contains the derived binaries. SCM keeps track of source code (file) modifications (commits) and the revision history of each commit. Commits are compressed and will be enlarged (uncompressed/extracted) when modifications are required. There are two types of repositories: a single repository and a distributed repository.\n3.  **Isolation:** Each programmer has at least one workspace. As a result, the developer modifies the source code, compiles the files, tests the code, and debugs it without interfering with the work of other developers.\n\n#### 3.5.6 Building\n\n*   Efficiency is a key requirement of SCM systems so that developers can quickly build an executable file from the versioned source files.\n*   SCM systems must enable the building of old versions of the system for recovery, testing, maintenance, or additional release purposes.\n*   Most SCM systems support building of software.\n*   The build process and their products are assessed for quality assurance.\n*   Outputs of the build process become quality assurance records, and these records may be needed for future reference.\n\n#### 3.5.7 Change Management\n\n*   SCM systems must:\n    *   Enable users to understand the impact of modifications.\n    *   Enable users to identify the products to which a specific modification applies.\n    *   Provide maintenance personnel with tools for change management so that all activities from specifying requirements to coding can be traced.\n\n#### 3.5.8 Status Accounting\n\n*   To quantify the properties of the software being developed and the process being used, it is necessary to gather statistics at the SCM level.\n*   The primary purpose of status accounting is to:\n    *   Keep formal records of already existing configurations.\n    *   Produce periodic reports about the status of the configurations.\n*   These records:\n    *   Describe the product correctly.\n    *   Are used to verify the configuration of the system for testing and delivery.\n    *   Maintain a history of CRs, including both approved and rejected ones.\n\n#### 3.5.9 Auditing\n\n*   SCM systems need to provide the following features:\n    *   Return to prior stable points (Rollback).\n    *   Determine which alterations were made, why they were made, and who made them.\n*   Two kinds of audits are performed before a software is released:\n    *   **Audit for functional configuration:** Determines whether or not the software satisfies both the user and system requirements.\n    *   **Audit for physical configuration:** Checks to see if the program is appropriately represented in the reference and design documentation.\n\n### 3.6 SCM Process\n\n#### 3.6.1 Establishing Baselines\n\n*   To find out if something is subject to configuration management. Only a few instances have code, data, and documentation.\n*   After configuration items have been identified, a software baseline library is constructed to make the list of changeable items publicly available.\n*   The library, also known as the repository, is at the heart of the SCM system.\n*   All public configurations are saved in the repository, which is a central location.\n*   The repository has data on all of the things that have been baselined.\n\n#### 3.6.2 Baseline (or Re-baseline) Process Activities\n\n*   Create a snapshot of the current version of the product and its configuration elements, then assign the complete configuration a configuration identifier.\n*   Check in the configuration and assign version numbers to the configuration objects.\n*   In the repository, store the approved authority information as meta data.\n*   Distribute all of the following information to all stakeholders.\n*   Create a schema of words, numbers, or letters for common sorts of configuration objects to reliably identify the configuration version.\n*   Particular nomenclature may be required by project needs.\n\n#### 3.6.3 Controlling, Documenting, and Auditing\n\n*   After establishing a baseline, it is important to maintain consistency between the actual and documented configurations, and ensure that the baseline corresponds with the project\'s requirements document configuration.\n*   At regular intervals, records and products are audited to verify that:\n    *   There is an appropriate match between the documented and actual configurations.\n    *   The configuration complies with the project\'s criteria.\n    *   All change activity documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date.\n*   Controlling, documenting, and auditing are the three steps in the cycle that are repeated throughout the project\'s life cycle.\n\n### 3.7 SCM Tools - Features\n\n#### 3.7.1 Version Control\n\n*   One of the key features offered by SCM tools is version control.\n*   These tools utilize an archiving method to save every change made to a file, allowing users to revert to a previous version if any issues arise. (Mentor, 2023)\n\n#### 3.7.2 Synchronization\n\n*   Another essential feature of SCM tools is synchronization.\n*   This allows users to check out multiple files or even a complete repository.\n*   After working on the necessary files, users can commit their changes back to the repository.\n*   Additionally, they can periodically update their local copies to reflect changes made by other team members, which is referred to as synchronization. (Mentor, 2023)\n\n#### 3.7.3 Concurrency Management\n\n*   Concurrency refers to the occurrence of multiple tasks simultaneously.\n*   In the context of SCM, it refers to different individuals editing the same file at the same time.\n*   If concurrency is not effectively managed with SCM tools, it can lead to significant issues. (Mentor, 2023)\n\n#### 3.7.4 Automation\n\n*   SCM tools decisively automate critical tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software.\n*   This automation significantly reduces manual effort, boosts efficiency, and minimizes errors.\n*   Examples of effective tools include Jenkins and TeamCity for build automation, while Ansible and Chef excel in automated deployments.\n\n#### 3.7.5 Dependency Mapping\n\n*   These tools effectively visualize and manage the relationships between different configuration items and services.\n*   This capability is essential for understanding the impact of changes and maintaining system health.\n\n### 3.8 SCM Tools – Examples\n\n*   Docker\n*   SolarWinds\n*   Octopus Deploy\n*   PowerShell\n*   ConfigHub\n\n### 3.9 References\n\n*   Blokdyk.

As a result, all changes must be compatible with the existing software architecture, design, and code limitations.\n\n#### Shorter Time Frame\n\nMaintenance activities might last anywhere from a few hours to many months, but software creation can take up to a year.\n\n#### Available Test Data\n\nTest cases are created from scratch during software development, however software maintenance can choose a portion of these test cases and run them as regression tests. As a result, selecting acceptable test cases from the existing test suite is a hurdle. To effectively test the code changes, in addition to the regression test cases, new test cases must be written.\n\n### Intention-Based Classification\n\nAccording to ISO/IEC 14764, the categories of software maintenance are:\n\n*   Corrective\n*   Adaptive\n*   Perfective\n*   Preventive\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n#### Corrective Maintenance\n\nReact to problems that are uncovered. Unplanned (unscheduled) software maintenance is also required to allow the software to function.\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n#### Adaptive Maintenance\n\nMaintain software usability in an ever-changing environment. For example, software modifications may be required as a result of an operating system upgrade.\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n#### Perfective Maintenance\n\nThe goal is to increase user experience, processing efficiency, and maintainability, among other things.\nFor a better user experience, the programme outputs can be made more understandable; the programme can be updated to make it faster, hence enhancing processing efficiency.\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n#### Preventive Maintenance\n\nAfter-sales modification of a software product to uncover and remedy fundamental flaws before they become operational flaws.\nFor example, with good programming styles, the impact of change is reduced, thereby reducing the number of failures.\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n### Activity-Based Classification\n\nThe intention of an activity depends upon the reason for the change.\nTwo categories: corrections and enhancements.\n\n#### Corrections\n\nThe activities in this category are intended to correct system flaws, which are defined as a difference between the expected and actual behaviour of the system.\n\n|               | Enhancement   | Correction   |\n| :------------ | :------------ | :----------- |\n| **Proactive** | Perfective    | Preventive   |\n| **Reactive**  | Adaptive      | Corrective   |\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K.

(2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n#### Classification Elements\n\nThe types of maintenance activities are clustered based on modifications made, detected, or observed on four elements of the system being maintained:\n\n*   The entire software.\n*   The external documentation.\n*   The properties of the program code.\n*   The experience of the customer on system functionality.\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K.

Springer Vieweg.\n\n### Issues and Challenges in Software Maintenance\n\n#### Costs\n\nSoftware maintenance is a big part of the overall development process, consuming between 60% and 80% of total costs. Most of these expenses come from making enhancements or updates to the software rather than fixing errors.\n\n#### Impact Analysis\n\nOne major challenge in maintaining software is understanding how changes will affect the rest of the system. Impact analysis helps assess the possible outcomes of a modification, aiming to minimize unexpected problems. This process includes checking if the proposed change is correct, evaluating risks, and estimating how it will impact system performance and development.\n\n(Gupta et al., n.d.)\n\n#### Corrective Changes\n\nCorrective changes can be tricky because it\'s often hard to identify where exactly changes need to be made in the code. Recognizing the relevant parts of the codebase can be difficult. Even small modifications might require significant changes to the software\'s structure, which can be time-consuming. If a workaround has already been implemented for a problem, fixing new issues can become even more complicated. Repairing design flaws is challenging since it requires a deep understanding of the entire codebase and comes with risks.\n\n#### Adaptive Changes\n\nAdaptive changes, which involve updating the software to work with new technologies, can also be hard. Sometimes, there\'s not enough information about what the software needs to change to. Understanding new technologies and how to integrate them can be difficult. Additionally, issues may arise from a lack of proper initial design.\n\n#### Program Comprehension\n\nProgram comprehension is another important aspect. Maintenance engineers often spend a lot of time reading and understanding the code and documentation to grasp the logic, purpose, and structure of the software. This understanding is crucial for effectively maintaining and improving the quality of the software.\n\n(Gupta et al., n.d.)\n\n### IEEE Maintenance Process (IEEE 1219)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Problem Identification & Classification] --> B(Request);\n    B --> C{Analysis};\n    C --> D(Design);\n    D --> E(Implementation);\n    E --> F(System Test);\n    F --> G(Acceptance Test);\n    G --> H(Delivery);\n```\n\nSource: Tripathy, P., Naik K.

What is the type of data you are OK with losing?\n*   **Geographic location:** Does this impact multiple AWS Regions? Do different Regions require different measurements of how quickly they must recover and how much data loss is OK?\n*   **Cost:** Does the cost represent the correct level considering business impact and risk?\n\n### 2.4 Determining RPO (Recovery Point Objective)\nRPO is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time.\nHow often must your data be backed up?\n*   **Example:** Determine that a loss of a maximum of 800 records is acceptable for your application. Use existing patterns to determine that no more than 100 records are created an hour. Calculate that an RPO of 8 hours (8 * 100 records) is acceptable. Based on this information, if a disaster occurred at 10 p.m., the system should be able to recover all data that was in the system before 2 p.m.\n\n### 2.5 Determining RTO (Recovery Time Objective)\nRTO is the maximum acceptable amount of time after a disaster strikes that a business process can remain out of commission.\nHow quickly must your applications and data be recovered?\n*   **Example:** Determine that a ticketing service for a local music venue can be restored within 2 hours. The business calculates that after 2 hours of an outage, it will begin to lose revenue from lost sales. Calculate that an RTO of 2 hours is acceptable. Based on this information, if a disaster occurred at 9 p.m., the system should be returned to service before 11 p.m.\n\n### 2.6 Preparing a BCP (Business Continuity Plan)\nA business continuity plan (BCP) is a system of prevention and recovery from potential threats to a company.\nA BCP consists of the following:\n*   Business impact analysis\n*   Risk assessment\n*   Disaster recovery plan\n*   Evaluated and determined RPO and RTO\n\n### 2.7 Key Takeaways: Disaster Planning Strategies\n*   Failures can occur at any time and on a small, large, or global scale.\n*   A disaster recovery plan will help limit business and customer impact when a disaster occurs.\n*   RPO is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss after an unplanned data-loss incident.\n*   RTO is the amount of time an application, system, and process can be down without causing significant damage to the business.\n*   A BCP is a system of prevention and recovery from potential threats to a company that includes RPO and RTO.\n\n---\n\n## Chapter 3: AWS Disaster Recovery Planning\n\n### 3.1 DR Plans Span More Than One Region\n\n### 3.2 Storage and Backup Building Blocks\n*   **On-premises data center:** Tape, Gateway (File Gateway, Volume Gateway), DataSync agent, AWS Direct Connect\n*   **AWS Cloud:** AWS DataSync, AWS Storage Gateway, Amazon EBS, Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, Amazon S3, Amazon S3 Glacier\n\n### 3.3 Configuring Cross-Region Replication\n*   **AWS Cloud Region A:** Source S3 bucket (replication configured)\n*   **Region B:** Destination S3 bucket\n\n### 3.4 EBS Volume Snapshots\n*   **AWS Cloud Region A:** Source EBS volume, Snapshot stored in Amazon S3\n*   **Region B:** Copy of snapshot\n\n### 3.5 File System Replication\n*   **AWS Cloud Region A:** Source Amazon EFS or Amazon FSx\n*   **Region B:** Destination Amazon EFS or Amazon FSx\n*   **On-premises data center:** Source file system\n*   **Connectivity:** AWS Direct Connect (optional), AWS DataSync\n\n### 3.6 Recovering Compute Infrastructure\nObtain and boot new server instances or containers in minutes.\n*   **Custom AMIs (Golden AMIs)**\n*   **Custom container images**\n*   **Auto Scaling group:** EC2 Instance 1, EC2 Instance 2, EC2 Instance 3\n*   **Amazon Elastic Container Service cluster:** ECS Container 1, ECS Container 2, ECS Container 3, ECS Container 4\n\n### 3.7 Harnessing EventBridge for Regional Failover\n*   **Primary Region:** Global endpoint, Alarm, Event producer, PutEvents, Amazon EventBridge, Orders event bus, Event consumers, Archive\n*   **Secondary Region:** Amazon Route 53 health check, Failover, Global endpoint, managed rule\n*   **Connectivity:** Global endpoint, Alarm\n\n### 3.8 Designing for Resiliency and Recovery\n*   **Route 53:** Provides DNS-based load balancing.

interfering* with others.\\n\\n#### 3.5.6 Building\\n\\n*   *Efficiency* is key: quick build of executable files from versioned sources.\\n*   SCM systems must enable building *old versions* for recovery, testing, etc.\\n*   Most SCM systems support software building.\\n*   Build process and products are assessed for *quality assurance*.\\n*   Build outputs serve as *quality assurance records*.\\n\\n#### 3.5.7 Change Management\\n\\n*   SCM systems must:\\n    *   Enable understanding of *impact of modifications*.\\n    *   Identify products affected by a specific modification.\\n    *   Provide tools for tracing activities from requirements to coding.\\n\\n#### 3.5.8 Status Accounting\\n\\n*   Quantify properties of the software and the process.\\n*   Gather statistics at the SCM level.\\n*   Primary purposes:\\n    *   Keep formal records of existing configurations.\\n    *   Produce periodic status reports.\\n*   Records:\\n    *   Describe the product correctly.\\n    *   Verify system configuration for testing and delivery.\\n    *   Maintain history of Change Requests (CRs) (approved and rejected).\\n\\n#### 3.5.9 Auditing\\n\\n*   SCM systems need features for:\\n    *   *Rollback* to prior stable points.\\n    *   Determine *what*, *why*, and *who* made alterations.\\n*   Two audit types before release:\\n    *   **Functional Configuration Audit**: Checks if software meets user and system requirements.\\n    *   **Physical Configuration Audit**: Verifies program representation in reference and design documentation.\\n\\n### 3.6 SCM Process\\n\\n#### 3.6.1 Establishing Baselines\\n\\n*   Identifies items subject to configuration management (code, data, documentation).\\n*   After identification, a *software baseline library* (repository) is constructed.\\n*   Repository: *central location* for all public configurations.\\n*   Stores data on all baselined items.\\n\\n#### 3.6.2 Baseline (or Re-baseline) Process Activities\\n\\n*   Create a snapshot of the current product version.\\n*   Assign a *configuration identifier* to the complete configuration.\\n*   Check in the configuration, assign version numbers to objects.\\n*   Store approved authority information as *metadata* in the repository.\\n*   Distribute information to all stakeholders.\\n*   Create a *schema* (words, numbers, letters) for reliably identifying configuration versions.\\n*   Project needs may require *particular nomenclature*.\\n\\n#### 3.6.3 Controlling, Documenting, and Auditing\\n\\n*   After baseline establishment, maintain consistency between *actual* and *documented* configurations.\\n*   Ensure baseline matches project requirements document configuration.\\n*   Regularly audit records and products to verify:\\n    *   Match between documented and actual configurations.\\n    *   Configuration complies with project criteria.\\n    *   All change activity documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date.\\n*   *Controlling, documenting, and auditing* form a cycle repeated throughout the project life cycle.\\n\\n### 3.7 SCM Tools - Features\\n\\n#### 3.7.1 Version Control\\n\\n*   Key feature of SCM tools.\\n*   Uses an *archiving method* to save every file change.\\n*   Allows reverting to previous versions.\\n\\n#### 3.7.2 Synchronization\\n\\n*   Allows users to *check out* multiple files or a complete repository.\\n*   Commit changes back to the repository.\\n*   Periodically *update local copies* to reflect changes from other team members.\\n\\n#### 3.7.3 Concurrency Management\\n\\n*   Refers to multiple tasks happening *simultaneously*.\\n*   In SCM: different individuals editing the *same file* at the same time.\\n*   Effective management prevents significant issues.\\n\\n#### 3.7.4 Automation\\n\\n*   Automates critical tasks: *building, testing, deploying*.\\n*   Reduces manual effort, boosts efficiency, minimizes errors.\\n*   Examples: Jenkins, TeamCity (build automation); Ansible, Chef (deployment).\\n\\n#### 3.7.5 Dependency Mapping\\n\\n*   Visualizes and manages relationships between configuration items and services.\\n*   Essential for understanding *impact of changes* and maintaining system health.\\n\\n### 3.8 SCM Tools – Examples\\n\\n*   Docker\\n*   SolarWinds\\n*   Octopus Deploy\\n*   PowerShell\\n*   ConfigHub\\n\\n### 3.9 References\\n\\n*

(108, 2000000060, 'Software Configuration Management', 'Software Configuration Management (SCM) is a discipline focused on systematically controlling changes to software products throughout their lifecycle, ensuring integrity and traceability. Its primary goals are to manage corrections, extensions, and adaptations, identify and retain all versions of software and documentation, and provide an audit trail for modifications. SCM offers benefits like reduced confusion, improved productivity, cost savings, enhanced quality, and compliance with standards. The four core elements of CM are identification, control, auditing, and accounting of software configurations. Technical dimensions involve version control, system models, workspace control, building, change management, status accounting, and auditing. The SCM process involves establishing baselines, controlling, documenting, and auditing configurations, with SCM tools providing features like version control, synchronization, concurrency management, automation, and dependency mapping.', '2025-11-19 15:45:28');
