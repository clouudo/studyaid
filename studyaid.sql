(706, 37, 'e Costs and Design)\n*   Maintenance costs increase significantly in later life cycle stages, necessitating meticulous software engineering.\n*   Disciplined change control and testing are critical to mitigate system degradation from modifications.\n*   Conducting impact analysis is essential to limit unintended consequences.\n*   Designing maintainability into software helps make modifications manageable.\n*   Maintenance cost estimation should begin early in development planning, using historical data as a baseline.\n*   Estimates are refined with project progression and additional information.\n*   Categorizing costs reveals resource allocation, with most expenditures on enhancements rather than repairs.\n\n### Definition – Software Maintenance\n*   “The process of

(709, 37, ' DevOps\n\n*   DevOps is a software development methodology that streamlines the delivery of high-performance applications by integrating and automating the work of development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams, which traditionally functioned in silos. It promotes collaboration and coordination between these teams.\n*   Key features of DevOps include continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), allowing for smaller, faster software updates through frequent merging, testing, and deployment of new code. This approach evolves from agile software development, which emphasizes iterative processes over the traditional waterfall model that involves lengthy development and testing phases.\n*   Ultimately,

The objective is to create a prioritized backlog of features, improvements, and bug fixes.\n\n#### Coding\n*   The DevOps team develops features from the backlog using common practices like test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and peer code reviews. Code is initially written and tested on local workstations before advancing in the continuous delivery pipeline.\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n#### Building\n*   New code is integrated into the existing code base, then tested and packaged for release.

(714, 37, 'e DevOps arena. Coding continues to be celebrated as the most exciting aspect of work within this field. While DevOps has succeeded in connecting those who code with those who maintain, it hasn’t yet made maintenance itself a more attractive aspect of the job.\n*   This perception may need to evolve. Organizations that are ahead of the curve should acknowledge that software maintenance—which encompasses activities like applying updates, monitoring applications, and scaling infrastructure—is just as critical for ensuring a smooth application experience as the software itself. This recognition should be explicitly integrated into the DevOps approach.\n*   Source: https://devops.com/making-software-maintenance-cool-devops/\n\n## References\n\n*   Blokdyk. G. ((2020).

restructuring of an existing software system to reconstitute it in a new form and the subsequent implementation of the new form.\n\n*   **Goals of Re-engineering:**\n    *   Understand existing software system artifacts (specification, design, implementation, and documentation).\n    *   Improve the functionality and quality attributes of the system (e.g., evolvability, performance, reusability).\n\n#### 4.2 Risks Involved in Re-Engineering\n\n*   The target system may not have the same functionality as the existing system.\n*   The target system may be of lower quality than the

4.6.2 Horse Shoe Model\n\n*   **Description:** The reengineering process is often divided into three stages:\n    1.  **Reverse Engineering:** May be required if the technological platform is obsolete or original creators are unavailable.\n    2.  **Software Reorganization (Software Restructuring):** Aims to improve key components of the system.\n    3.  **Forward Engineering:** Designing a new running system based on the restructured model.\n\n*   **Formula:** Reengineering = Reverse engineering + Δ + Forward engineering\n    *   \"Δ\" captures alterations made to the original system.\n

system.\n\n#### 4.8 Software Re-Engineering Strategies\n\n*   **Rewrite Strategy:**\n    *   Reflects the principle of alteration.\n    *   An operational system is turned into a new system while maintaining the previous system\'s abstraction level.\n    *   Example: Rewriting Fortran code using the C language.\n\n*   **Rework Strategy:**\n    *   Applies all three principles: abstraction,

The extent of reengineering performed.\n2.  The rate of substitution of the operational system with the new one.\n\n##### 4.10.1 Big Bang Approach\n\n*   Replaces the entire system at the same time.\n*   Project continues until all objectives

(728, 39, 'ncremental Approach\n\n*   The system is reengineered gradually, one step closer to the target system at a time.\n*   **Benefits:**\n    *   Easy detection of mistakes due to identifiable new components.\n    *   Easier for the client to detect progress through intermediate versions.\n    *   Less risky than the \"Big Bang\" method.\n*   **Disadvantages:**\n    *   Takes longer to complete due to multiple interim versions and careful version control.\n    *   The entire architecture of the system cannot be changed even if needed.\n\n##### 4.10.3 Partial Approach\n\n*   Only a part of the system is reengineered and then integrated with the non-engineered portion.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Partition the existing system into two parts: one to be reengineered, the other not.\n    2.  Use either the \"Big Bang\" or \"Incremental\" approach to reengineer the chosen part.\n    3.

(729, 39, 'r the \"Big Bang\" or \"Incremental\" approach to reengineer the chosen part.\n    3.  Combine the reengineered part and the non-reengineered part to form the new system.\n\n##### 4.10.4 Iterative Approach\n\n*   Reengineering is performed on the source code of a few procedures at a time, with each operation being short.\n*   This procedure is repeated on several components at different stages.\n\n##### 4.10.5 Evolutionary Approach\n\n*   Similar to the \"Incremental\" approach.\n*   Components of the original system are substituted with reengineered components.\n*   Existing components are grouped by functions and reengineered into new components.\n\n#### 4.11

Engineering\n\n*   **Definition:** A process to:\n    *   Define the components of operational software.\n    *   Define the interactions between those components.\n    *   Represent the system at a higher degree of abstraction or in another form.\n    *   Extracts information from current software artifacts and converts it into abstract models that maintenance people can understand.\n\n*   **Factors Necessitating Reverse Engineering:**\n    *   Original programmers have left the organization.\n    *   Implementation language has become obsolete, requiring migration.\n    *

Backus-Naur Form (BNF).\n*   Parsers can be built automatically from a description of a programming language\'s features.\n*   Example parsing tool: YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler).\n\n##### 4.13.3 Control Flow Analysis\n\n*   **Types:**\n    *   **Intra-procedural Analysis:**\n        *   Shows the order of statement execution within a subprogram.\n        *   Performed by generating Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) of subprograms.\n    *   **Inter-procedural Analysis:**\n        *   Performed by constructing a call graph.\n        *   Represents calling relationships between

Version Control\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Every time an artifact is modified, a new identifier is assigned to the artifact to minimize confusion during the evolution process.\n*   **Consideration:** Giving each alteration of the same artifact a new identification can obscure essential relationships between the objects that are individually recognized.\n\n#### 3.7.3 System Models and Selection\n\n*   **Defined Items:** Requirement specifications, test cases, design, code, test results, and defect reports are all examples of well-defined items in a project that are described in

The original files in the repository do not need to be locked.\n*   **Building:** To save space, an SCM system usually saves the differences between subsequent versions. As a result, the workspace converts the deltas into entire source files. The workspace also contains the derived binaries.

SCM keeps track of source code (file) modifications (commits) and the revision history of each commit. The commits are compressed and will be enlarged (uncompressed/extracted) when the modifications for the specific commits are required. There are two types of repositories: a single repository and a distributed repository.\n*   **Isolation:** Each programmer has at least one workspace. As a result, the developer modifies the source code, compiles the files, tests the code, and debugs it without interfering with the work of other developers.\n\n#### 3.7.5 Building\n\n*

(752, 40, 'nchronization\n\n*   **Essential Feature:** Another essential feature of SCM tools is synchronization.\n*   **Functionality:** This allows users to check out multiple files or even a complete repository. After working on the necessary files, users can commit their changes back to the repository. Additionally, they can periodically update their local copies to reflect changes made by other team members, which is referred to as synchronization. (Mentor, 2023)\n\n#### 3.9.3 Concurrency Management\n\n*   **Definition:** Concurrency refers to the occurrence of multiple tasks simultaneously.

As a result, selecting acceptable test cases from the existing test suite is a hurdle. To effectively test the code changes, in addition to the regression test cases, new test cases must be written.\n\n### Intention-Based Classification\n\nAccording to ISO/IEC 14764, the categories of software maintenance are:\n\n*   Corrective\n*   Adaptive\n*   Perfective\n*   Preventive\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n#### Corrective Maintenance\n\nReact to problems that are uncovered.

Ordinary preventive efforts of this type make improvements to improve maintainability and lay the groundwork for a future transition to an emerging technology. Performance activities provide results that have an influence on the user. These operations increase system uptime by replacing slower components and algorithms. Ordinary Adaptive actions of this sort migrate software to a new execution platform and increase the use of COTS components.\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014).

Impact analysis helps assess the possible outcomes of a modification, aiming to minimize unexpected problems. This process includes checking if the proposed change is correct, evaluating risks, and estimating how it will impact system performance and development.\n\n### Corrective Changes\n\nCorrective changes can be tricky because it\'s often hard to identify where exactly changes need to be made in the code. Recognizing the relevant parts of the codebase can be difficult. Even small modifications might require significant changes to the software\'s structure, which can be time-consuming.

(769, 41, 'ht require significant changes to the software\'s structure, which can be time-consuming. If a workaround has already been implemented for a problem, fixing new issues can become even more complicated. Repairing design flaws is challenging since it requires a deep understanding of the entire codebase and comes with risks.\n\n### Adaptive Changes\n\nAdaptive changes, which involve updating the software to work with new technologies, can also be hard. Sometimes, there\'s not enough information about what the software needs to change to. Understanding new technologies and how to integrate them can be difficult.

(777, 41, 'ement Model Description\n\n*   Based on the Japanese concept of Kaizen, which stands for the gradual and systematic enhancement of procedures.\n*   First changes are made to the highest level documents.\n*   Eventually, changes are propagated down to the code level.\n*   Assumes complete documentation is available.\n*   It begins with the existing system’s artifacts, namely, requirements, design, code, test, and analysis documents.\n*   It revises the highest-level documents affected by the changes and propagates the changes down through the lower-level documents.\n*

(2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n##### Full Reuse Model Activities\n\nFull reuse comprises two major steps:\n\n1.  Perform requirement analysis and design of the new system.\n2.

Overlooking these challenges may jeopardize the stability, improvement, and lifespan of systems in operation.\n*   Life-cycle sustainment factors involve supply, maintenance, transportation, sustaining engineering, data management, configuration management, Human Systems Integration (HSI), environmental and occupational health and safety (including explosives safety), protection of essential program information and anti-tamper measures, supportability, and interoperability.\n\n### Definition - Software Sustainment\n*   “The processes, procedures, people, material, and information required to support, maintain, and operate the software aspects of a system.” - SEI Working Definition\n\n### Criteria to Enter Software Sustainment (Lapham & Sei, 2014)\n*   **Stable software production baseline**—Sustainment organizations typically require software to be stable before they will accept it for ongoing maintenance.\n*   **Complete and current software documentation**—Having thorough and up-to-date software documentation is essential for the software sustainment team.\n*   **Authority to Operate (ATO) for an operational software system**—An Authority to Operate must be granted before any software system can be deemed operational in the field and eligible for sustainment.\n*   **Current and negotiated Sustainment Transition Plan**—Often, a program may have been developed, tested, and deemed operational, yet there may be no allocated funding for the creation and negotiation of the Sustainment Transition Plan.\n*   **Sustainment staffing and training plan**—It is crucial to properly staff the sustainment organization. The team should consist of trained software professionals who can collaborate with the development organization to ensure the necessary system knowledge is transferred.\n\n### Challenges of Sustainment (Lapham & Sei, 2014)\n*   Sustaining COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) software involves addressing various factors such as system obsolescence, technology updates, source code escrow, and vendor license management, among other related aspects.\n*   Programmatic considerations highlight the challenges of categorizing sustainment needs as “minor requirements.”\n*   The transition to a sustainment phase examines elements like support database migration, the infrastructure for development and software support (including software testing labs, hardware spare parts, and procedures for releases), workforce needs, training for operations, and planning for the transition.\n*   User support covers topics such as help desk services, user manuals, and training for users.\n*   Information assurance addresses the specific challenges associated with IA in relation to COTS software products and the testing required for IA.\n\n### Software Maintenance - Basic Concepts\n*   Software maintenance is essential to ensure the long-term viability of software products throughout their lifecycle. i.e. from conception to completion.\n*   Changes to the software product are documented, the effects (impacts) of the changes are discovered, artefacts are modified, testing is performed, and a new software release is prepared.\n*   Users are educated, and assistance is available at all times.\n*   The term \"maintainer\" refers to a company or organisation that provides maintenance work.\n    *   Source: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n### Basic Concepts (Software Maintenance)\n*   Software maintenance aims to update and improve existing software efficiently while maintaining its integrity.\n*   It ensures that the software continues to function throughout its lifespan, adapts to changing user needs, and addresses issues that arise after deployment.\n*   The main objective is to extend the software’s useful life and postpone the need for replacement. Maintenance engineering uses established software engineering principles to systematically update operational software.\n*   Rigorous change management and regression testing prevent quality from declining. Additionally, maintenance offers ongoing user support, training, and monitors satisfaction.\n\n### Basic Concepts (Software Maintenance Costs and Design)\n*   Maintenance costs increase significantly in later life cycle stages, necessitating meticulous software engineering.\n*   Disciplined change control and testing are critical to mitigate system degradation from modifications.\n*   Conducting impact analysis is essential to limit unintended consequences.\n*   Designing maintainability into software helps make modifications manageable.\n*   Maintenance cost estimation should begin early in development planning, using historical data as a baseline.\n*   Estimates are refined with project progression and additional information.\n*   Categorizing costs reveals resource allocation, with most expenditures on enhancements rather than repairs.\n\n### Definition – Software Maintenance\n*   “The process of modifying a software system or component after delivery to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environment.” - IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology\n\n### Reasons of Maintenance\n*   Prevent software operation from failure.\n*   Fix discovered software bugs.\n*   Improve software. Eg. to link or access to other new devices.\n*   Ensure software works in different environment (if required).\n*   Provide better experiences to users.\n*   Comply with organizational goal (if changes).\n\n### Software Development vs Software Maintenance\n\n| Feature                 | SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT                                                                    | SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE                                                                                      |\n| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Driver**              | requirements driven                                                                     | event driven                                                                                              |\n| **Process Start**       | Process begins with the objective of designing and implementing a system to deliver certain functional and nonfunctional requirements. | scheduled in response to an event.                                                                        |\n| **Nature of Work**      | Primary/First Implementation.                                                           | on-going administration/support.                                                                          |\n| **Action**              | Development of software from new.                                                       | Modifying or adding new features based on existing software.

It promotes collaboration and coordination between these teams.\n*   Key features of DevOps include continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), allowing for smaller, faster software updates through frequent merging, testing, and deployment of new code. This approach evolves from agile software development, which emphasizes iterative processes over the traditional waterfall model that involves lengthy development and testing phases.\n*   Ultimately, DevOps focuses on meeting user demands for innovative features and consistent performance. - IBM\n\n### DevOps Life-Cycle\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n#### Planning\n*   Teams identify new features and functions for upcoming releases, using user feedback and insights from internal stakeholders like engineers and compliance teams. The objective is to create a prioritized backlog of features, improvements, and bug fixes.\n\n#### Coding\n*   The DevOps team develops features from the backlog using common practices like test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and peer code reviews. Code is initially written and tested on local workstations before advancing in the continuous delivery pipeline.\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n#### Building\n*   New code is integrated into the existing code base, then tested and packaged for release. Automation plays a key role in merging, storing, and compiling code into executable files, with outputs saved in a binary repository for future use.\n\n#### Testing\n*   DevOps teams utilise automated testing throughout the development process, including unit tests during coding and linting after integration. Continuous testing allows for early detection of issues, implementing a \"shift-left\" approach.\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n#### Release\n*   In the final workflow before user access, teams conduct thorough testing to ensure the software meets quality and security standards. Any identified defects are corrected before the application is launched into the production environment, often using automated processes.\n\n#### Deploy\n*   The updated application moves to a production environment, initially deployed to a subset of users to verify stability before a full rollout.\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n#### Operate\n*   DevOps teams ensure new features are functioning correctly with no service interruptions, employing automated tools for continuous monitoring and optimisation of operations.\n\n#### Monitor\n*   Feedback from users and insights from previous workflows are collected to improve future processes and inform planning for the next release of new features.\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n### DevOps Culture\n*   The DevOps culture emphasises collaboration, communication, and automation among all stakeholders involved in software delivery, including development, IT operations, compliance, and security teams.\n*   It requires continuous interaction and shared responsibility to foster innovation and prioritise quality from the outset. At a technical level, DevOps leverages automated tools for testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning to enhance project delivery and minimise errors.\n*   Feedback and measurement are essential for optimising processes and improving software quality. To implement a DevOps culture, organisations often need to dismantle silos and form cross-functional teams that manage projects from start to finish, promoting accountability and collaboration in alignment with agile practices.\n    *   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n### DevOps and Maintenance\n*   One of the most significant—yet often overlooked—impacts of the DevOps movement is its effort to make software maintenance appealing again. DevOps not only offers better organisational support for software maintenance but also enhances communication between developers and operations teams, leading to more effective maintenance strategies.\n*   A fundamental principle of DevOps is the \"you build it, you own it\" philosophy, which asserts that the developers who create code are also responsible for its deployment and ongoing maintenance. Even if the organisation doesn’t fully embrace this principle, it likely fosters increased collaboration between developers and IT operations. Consequently, when production issues arise or upgrades are necessary for maintaining reliability, developers are actively involved in resolving these matters.\n*   Source: https://devops.com/making-software-maintenance-cool-devops/\n\n### DevOps and Maintenance (Perception and Integration)\n*   Despite the focus on software maintenance in practice, conversations about maintenance tasks remain infrequent in the DevOps arena. Coding continues to be celebrated as the most exciting aspect of work within this field. While DevOps has succeeded in connecting those who code with those who maintain, it hasn’t yet made maintenance itself a more attractive aspect of the job.\n*   This perception may need to evolve. Organizations that are ahead of the curve should acknowledge that software maintenance—which encompasses activities like applying updates, monitoring applications, and scaling infrastructure—is just as critical for ensuring a smooth application experience as the software itself. This recognition should be explicitly integrated into the DevOps approach.\n*   Source: https://devops.com/making-software-maintenance-cool-devops/\n\n## References\n\n*   Blokdyk. G. ((2020).

→ what? → what and how? → how?`\n*   **Abstraction Process:** `how? → what and how? → what? → why?`\n\n#### 4.5 Principle of Alteration\n\n*   **Definition:** Alteration is the making of changes to a system representation without changing the degree of abstraction and without modification, deletion, or addition of information.\n\n#### 4.6 Models of Software Re-Engineering\n\n##### 4.6.1 General Model\n\n*(No specific details provided in the source content for the \"General Model\")*\n\n##### 4.6.2 Horse Shoe Model\n\n*   **Description:** The reengineering process is often divided into three stages:\n    1.  **Reverse Engineering:** May be required if the technological platform is obsolete or original creators are unavailable.\n    2.  **Software Reorganization (Software Restructuring):** Aims to improve key components of the system.\n    3.  **Forward Engineering:** Designing a new running system based on the restructured model.\n\n*   **Formula:** Reengineering = Reverse engineering + Δ + Forward engineering\n    *   \"Δ\" captures alterations made to the original system.\n    *   Two major dimensions of alteration are:\n        *   Change in functionality\n        *   Change in implementation technique\n\n#### 4.7 Changes on Characteristics of System\n\nFour groups of changes:\n\n*   **Recode:**\n    *   Alters implementation properties by recoding the source program.\n    *   Uses rephrasing and program translation at the source code level.\n\n*   **Redesign:**\n    *   Common changes to software design include:\n        *   Restructuring the architecture.\n        *   Modifying the data model.\n        *   Replacing a procedure or algorithm with a more efficient one.\n\n*   **Respecify:**\n    *   Modifies the system\'s required characteristics by:\n        *   Changing the requirements\' form.\n        *   Changing the requirements\' scope.\n\n*   **Rethink:**\n    *   Changes the concepts embodied in an existing system to build a system that solves a different challenge.\n    *   Alters the system\'s conceptual properties and can fundamentally alter the system.\n\n#### 4.8 Software Re-Engineering Strategies\n\n*   **Rewrite Strategy:**\n    *   Reflects the principle of alteration.\n    *   An operational system is turned into a new system while maintaining the previous system\'s abstraction level.\n    *   Example: Rewriting Fortran code using the C language.\n\n*   **Rework Strategy:**\n    *   Applies all three principles: abstraction, alteration, and refinement.\n    *   Uses abstraction to create a less detailed representation.\n    *   Alters the rebuilt system model without changing the abstraction level.\n    *   Uses refinement to produce an acceptable new system representation at a lower level of abstraction.\n\n*   **Replace Strategy:**\n    *   Applies abstraction and refinement.\n    *   Hides details of a characteristic to reconstruct the system at a higher abstraction level.\n    *   Applies refinement to form an appropriate representation for the target system at a lower degree of abstraction.\n\n#### 4.9 Reengineering Process Variation\n\n*   **Key:** Understanding whether a target system can be produced based on starting abstraction level, type of changes, and strategy used.\n    *   **Yes:** A target system can be produced.\n    *   **Yes\\*:** Same as \"Yes,\" but the starting degree of abstraction is lower than the uppermost degree of abstraction within the conceptual abstraction level.\n    *   **No:** Cannot start at abstraction level A, make B type of changes, using strategy C, because the starting abstraction level is too high.\n    *   **Bad:** A target system can be created, but the likelihood of achieving a good result is low.\n\n#### 4.10 Re-Engineering Approaches\n\nTwo aspects are considered:\n1.  The extent of reengineering performed.\n2.  The rate of substitution of the operational system with the new one.\n\n##### 4.10.1 Big Bang Approach\n\n*   Replaces the entire system at the same time.\n*   Project continues until all objectives are met and the target system is built.\n*   Adopted when part-by-part reengineering isn\'t possible.\n\n##### 4.10.2 Incremental Approach\n\n*   The system is reengineered gradually, one step closer to the target system at a time.\n*   **Benefits:**\n    *   Easy detection of mistakes due to identifiable new components.\n    *   Easier for the client to detect progress through intermediate versions.\n    *   Less risky than the \"Big Bang\" method.\n*   **Disadvantages:**\n    *   Takes longer to complete due to multiple interim versions and careful version control.\n    *   The entire architecture of the system cannot be changed even if needed.\n\n##### 4.10.3 Partial Approach\n\n*   Only a part of the system is reengineered and then integrated with the non-engineered portion.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Partition the existing system into two parts: one to be reengineered, the other not.\n    2.  Use either the \"Big Bang\" or \"Incremental\" approach to reengineer the chosen part.\n    3.  Combine the reengineered part and the non-reengineered part to form the new system.\n\n##### 4.10.4 Iterative Approach\n\n*   Reengineering is performed on the source code of a few procedures at a time, with each operation being short.\n*   This procedure is repeated on several components at different stages.\n\n##### 4.10.5 Evolutionary Approach\n\n*   Similar to the \"Incremental\" approach.\n*   Components of the original system are substituted with reengineered components.\n*   Existing components are grouped by functions and reengineered into new components.\n\n#### 4.11 Source Code Reengineering Reference Model (SCORE/RM)\n\n*   **Elements:**\n    *   Functions\n    *   Database repository\n    *   Documentation\n    *   Metrication\n*   **Purpose:** An approach to:\n    *   Understand the needs of the software.\n    *   Rationalize the system to be reengineered by eliminating redundant data and changing control flow.\n    *   Rebuild the software in accordance with best practices.\n\n##### 4.11.1 SCORE-RM Processes\n\n*(Visual representation from slide provided, outlining processes such as Analysis, Parsing, Transformation, Rationalization of Control Flow, Isolation, Normalization, Data Compression, Representation of Data, Interpretation, Functionalization, Programming Reading)*\n\n##### 4.11.2 Abstraction in SCORE-RM\n\n*(Visual representation from slide provided, outlining processes such as Identify Object Hierarchies, Separate operator from data, Group operators, Interpretation of object, Causation, Specify action, Specify software constraints, Regeneration, Generate detailed design, Create codes, Generate test cases, Certification, Conformance)*\n\n#### 4.12 Code Reverse Engineering\n\n*   **Definition:** A process to:\n    *   Define the components of operational software.\n    *   Define the interactions between those components.\n    *   Represent the system at a higher degree of abstraction or in another form.\n    *   Extracts information from current software artifacts and converts it into abstract models that maintenance people can understand.\n\n*   **Factors Necessitating Reverse Engineering:**\n    *   Original programmers have left the organization.\n    *   Implementation language has become obsolete, requiring migration.\n    *   Insufficient system documentation.\n    *   Business relies on software that is poorly understood.\n    *   Acquired system lacks full source code access.\n    *   System requires adaptations and/or enhancements.\n    *   Software does not operate as expected.\n\n#### 4.13 Reverse Engineering Techniques\n\n*   Lexical Analysis\n*   Syntactic Analysis\n*   Control Flow Analysis\n*   Data Flow Analysis\n*   Program Slicing\n*   Visualization\n*   Program Metrics\n\n##### 4.13.1 Lexical Analysis\n\n*   **Process:** Breaking down a source code sequence of characters into its constituent lexical units.\n*   Allows for various useful representations of program data.\n*   The cross-reference list is a commonly utilized program information.\n*   A lexical analyzer is a program that performs lexical analysis and is part of a compiler.\n\n##### 4.13.2 Syntactic Analysis\n\n*   **Process:** Performed by a parser.\n*   Uses context-free grammars, often expressed in Backus-Naur Form (BNF).\n*   Parsers can be built automatically from a description of a programming language\'s features.\n*   Example parsing tool: YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler).\n\n##### 4.13.3 Control Flow Analysis\n\n*   **Types:**\n    *   **Intra-procedural Analysis:**\n        *   Shows the order of statement execution within a subprogram.\n        *   Performed by generating Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) of subprograms.\n    *   **Inter-procedural Analysis:**\n        *   Performed by constructing a call graph.\n        *   Represents calling relationships between subroutines as a directed graph.\n\n##### 4.13.4 Data Flow Analysis (DFA)\n\n*   Concerns how values of defined variables flow through and are used in a program.\n*   Can detect the possibility of loops and data flow anomalies.\n*   Enables identification of:\n    *   Code that can never execute.\n    *   Variables used before they are defined.\n    *   Statements that might need alteration when a bug is fixed.\n\n##### 4.13.5 Program Slicing\n\n*   **Definition:** A program slice is a portion of a program with execution behavior identical to the original program concerning a given criterion, but potentially smaller.\n*   **Backward Slice:**\n    *   With respect to a variable `v` and a point `p`, it includes all instructions and predicates that affect the value of `v` at `p`.\n    *   Answers: \"What program components might affect a selected computation?\"\n*   **Forward Slicing:**\n    *   Includes all instructions and predicates that may depend on the value of `v` at `p`.\n    *   Answers: \"What program components might be affected by a selected computation?\"\n\n---\n\n#### References\n\n1.

This chapter concentrates on configuration management as it relates to IT software assets and CI/CD.\n\n### 3.3 SCM Objectives and Impact\n\n*   **Traceability and Systematic Processes:** SCM ensures that development processes are traceable and systematic so that all changes are precisely managed, resulting in the product always being in a well-defined state.\n*   **Quality and Productivity:** SCM enhances the quality of the delivered system and the productivity of the maintainers.\n\n### 3.4 Key SCM Functions\n\n*   Uniquely identify every version of every software at various points in time.\n*   Retain past versions of documentation and software.\n*   Provide a trail of audit for all modifications performed.\n*   Throughout the software lifecycle, maintain the traceability and integrity of the system changes.\n\n### 3.5 Benefits of Software Configuration Management\n\n#### 3.5.1 General Benefits\n\n*   Confusion is reduced and order is established.\n*   Allows for the evaluation, approval, and implementation of changes into a configuration item in SCM.\n*   Organizes necessary activities to maintain product integrity.\n*   Ensures correct product configurations.\n*   Quality is ensured, leading to better quality software that consumes less maintenance effort.\n\n#### 3.5.2 Enhanced Benefits\n\n*   Productivity is improved as analysts and programmers know exactly where to find any piece of the software.\n*   Liability is reduced by documenting the trail of actions.\n*   Cost savings are realized across the product development life cycle.\n*   Maintaining product integrity through defined, tracked, and audited CIs ensures that the product released to customers has a well-managed bill of materials, enabling conformance with requirements.\n*   A reliable working environment is provided.\n*   Compliance with standards is enhanced.\n*   Accounting of status is enhanced.\n\n### 3.6 Four Elements of Configuration Management (CM)\n\n1.  **Identification of software configurations:** This includes the definitions of the different artifacts, their baselines or milestones, and the changes to the artifacts.\n2.  **Control of software configurations:** This element is about controlling the ways artifacts or configurations are altered with the necessary technical and administrative support.\n3.  **Auditing software configurations:** This element is about making the current status of the software system in its lifecycle visible to management and determining whether or not the baselines meet their requirements.\n4.  **Accounting software configuration status:** This element is about providing an administrative history of how the software system has been altered, by recording the activities necessitated by the other three SCM elements.\n\n### 3.7 Technical Dimension of SCM\n\n#### 3.7.1 Identification\n\n*   **Function:** Identifies the items whose configurations must be maintained.\n*   **Identified Elements:** Specification, design, documentation, data, drawings, source code, executable code, test plan, test script, hardware components, and software development environment components such as compilers, debuggers, and emulators.\n*   **Configuration Baseline:** The configuration baseline is identified.\n\n#### 3.7.2 Version Control\n\n*   **Mechanism:** Every time an artifact is modified, a new identifier is assigned to the artifact to minimize confusion during the evolution process.\n*   **Consideration:** Giving each alteration of the same artifact a new identification can obscure essential relationships between the objects that are individually recognized.\n\n#### 3.7.3 System Models and Selection\n\n*   **Defined Items:** Requirement specifications, test cases, design, code, test results, and defect reports are all examples of well-defined items in a project that are described in discrete files.\n*   **Aggregate Artifacts:** The requirement for aggregate artifacts develops so that maintenance employees can use linkages between artifacts and attributes to guarantee consistency in large projects.\n*   **Models:** Models that support the concept of software configurations are used to capture relationships between artifacts and attributes.\n*   **Configuration Definition:** A configuration, by definition, is a collection of versionable elements. The concept of configuration increases the necessity for users to be able to access sections and versions of aggregated artifacts selectively.\n\n#### 3.7.4 Workspace Control\n\n*   **Purpose:** SCM systems use work areas to provide users with a private location where they can undertake the standard responsibilities of editing and maintaining their objects.\n*   **Environment:** The workspace is the environment that allows the maintainer to make and test changes in a controlled environment.\n*   **Realization:** A workspace can be realized in two ways:\n    *   As basic as the programmer\'s home directory while modifying files.\n    *   A more complex system like an integrated development environment and a database.\n\n##### 3.7.4.1 Three Basic Functions in Workplace\n\n*   **Sandbox:** Checked-out files are placed in a workspace where they can be freely changed. The original files in the repository do not need to be locked.\n*   **Building:** To save space, an SCM system usually saves the differences between subsequent versions. As a result, the workspace converts the deltas into entire source files. The workspace also contains the derived binaries. SCM keeps track of source code (file) modifications (commits) and the revision history of each commit. The commits are compressed and will be enlarged (uncompressed/extracted) when the modifications for the specific commits are required. There are two types of repositories: a single repository and a distributed repository.\n*   **Isolation:** Each programmer has at least one workspace. As a result, the developer modifies the source code, compiles the files, tests the code, and debugs it without interfering with the work of other developers.\n\n#### 3.7.5 Building\n\n*   **Efficiency:** A key requirement of SCM systems is that developers can quickly build an executable file from the versioned source files.\n*   **Recovery and Testing:** SCM systems must enable the building of old versions of the system for recovery, testing, maintenance, or additional release purposes.\n*   **Support:** Most SCM systems support building of software.\n*   **Quality Assurance:** The build process and their products are assessed for quality assurance. Outputs of the build process become quality assurance records, and these records may be needed for future reference.\n\n#### 3.7.6 Change Management\n\n*   **SCM System Capabilities:** SCM systems must:\n    *   Enable users to understand the impact of modifications.\n    *   Enable users to identify the products to which a specific modification applies.\n    *   Provide maintenance personnel with tools for change management so that all activities from specifying requirements to coding can be traced.\n\n#### 3.7.7 Status Accounting\n\n*   **Purpose:** To quantify the properties of the software being developed and the process being used by gathering statistics at the SCM level.\n*   **Primary Objectives:**\n    *   Keep formal records of already existing configurations.\n    *   Produce periodic reports about the status of the configurations.\n*   **Record Functions:**\n    *   Describe the product correctly.\n    *   Are used to verify the configuration of the system for testing and delivery.\n    *   Maintain a history of CRs (Change Requests), including both approved and rejected ones.\n\n#### 3.7.8 Auditing\n\n*   **SCM System Features:** SCM systems need to provide the following features:\n    *   Return to prior stable points (Rollback).\n    *   Determine which alterations were made, why they were made, and who made them.\n*   **Types of Audits (before software release):**\n    *   **Audit for functional configuration:** Determines whether or not the software satisfies both user and system requirements.\n    *   **Audit for physical configuration:** Checks to see if the program is appropriately represented in the reference and design documentation.\n\n### 3.8 SCM Process\n\n#### 3.8.1 Establishing Baselines\n\n*   **Purpose:** To determine if something is subject to configuration management. Only a few instances have code, data, and documentation.\n*   **Software Baseline Library:** After configuration items have been identified, a software baseline library is constructed to make the list of changeable items publicly available.\n*   **Repository:** The library, also known as the repository, is at the heart of the SCM system. All public configurations are saved in the repository, which is a central location. The repository contains data on all of the things that have been baselined.\n\n#### 3.8.2 Baseline (or Re-baseline) Process Activities\n\n*   Create a snapshot of the current version of the product and its configuration elements, then assign the complete configuration a configuration identifier.\n*   Check in the configuration and assign version numbers to the configuration objects.\n*   Store the approved authority information as metadata in the repository.\n*   Distribute all of the following information to all stakeholders.\n*   Create a schema of words, numbers, or letters for common sorts of configuration objects to reliably identify the configuration version. Particular nomenclature may be required by project needs.\n\n#### 3.8.3 Controlling, Documenting, and Auditing\n\n*   **Post-Baseline Maintenance:** After establishing a baseline, it is important to maintain consistency between the actual and documented configurations, and ensure that the baseline corresponds with the project\'s requirements document configuration.\n*   **Regular Audits:** At regular intervals, records and products are audited to verify that:\n    *   There is an appropriate match between the documented and actual configurations.\n    *   The configuration complies with the project\'s criteria.\n    *   All change activity documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date.\n*   **Cyclical Nature:** Controlling, documenting, and auditing are the three steps in the cycle that are repeated throughout the project\'s life cycle.\n\n### 3.9 SCM Tools - Features\n\n#### 3.9.1 Version Control\n\n*   **Key Feature:** One of the key features offered by SCM tools is version control.\n*   **Mechanism:** These tools utilize an archiving method to save every change made to a file, allowing users to revert to a previous version if any issues arise. (Mentor, 2023)\n\n#### 3.9.2 Synchronization\n\n*   **Essential Feature:** Another essential feature of SCM tools is synchronization.\n*   **Functionality:** This allows users to check out multiple files or even a complete repository. After working on the necessary files, users can commit their changes back to the repository. Additionally, they can periodically update their local copies to reflect changes made by other team members, which is referred to as synchronization. (Mentor, 2023)\n\n#### 3.9.3 Concurrency Management\n\n*   **Definition:** Concurrency refers to the occurrence of multiple tasks simultaneously. In the context of SCM, it refers to different individuals editing the same file at the same time.\n*   **Importance:** If concurrency is not effectively managed with SCM tools, it can lead to significant issues. (Mentor, 2023)\n\n#### 3.9.4 Automation\n\n*   **Tasks Automated:** SCM tools decisively automate critical tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software.\n*   **Benefits:** This automation significantly reduces manual effort, boosts efficiency, and minimizes errors.\n*   **Examples:** Jenkins and TeamCity for build automation, while Ansible and Chef excel in automated deployments.\n\n#### 3.9.5 Dependency Mapping\n\n*   **Capability:** These tools effectively visualize and manage the relationships between different configuration items and services.\n*   **Importance:** This capability is essential for understanding the impact of changes and maintaining system health.\n\n### 3.10 SCM Tools – Examples\n\n*   Docker\n*   SolarWinds\n*   Octopus Deploy\n*   PowerShell\n*   ConfigHub\n\n### 3.11 References\n\n*   Blokdyk.

(41, 2, NULL, 'Chapter 2.pptx.pdf', 'pdf', '# BMSE3014 Software Maintenance\n\n## Chapter 2: Taxonomy of Software Maintenance\n\n### Key Characteristics of Maintenance Activities\n\n*   Keeping an eye on the software\'s day-to-day operations\n*   Keeping software changes under control\n*   Improve the software\'s current functions\n*   Threats to security are identified, and security flaws are fixed\n*   Preventing software performance from deteriorating to unacceptable levels\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n### Characteristics of Software Maintenance\n\n#### Constraints of an Existing System\n\nOn an operational system, maintenance is carried out. As a result, all changes must be compatible with the existing software architecture, design, and code limitations.\n\n#### Shorter Time Frame\n\nMaintenance activities might last anywhere from a few hours to many months, but software creation can take up to a year.\n\n#### Available Test Data\n\nTest cases are created from scratch during software development, however software maintenance can choose a portion of these test cases and run them as regression tests. As a result, selecting acceptable test cases from the existing test suite is a hurdle. To effectively test the code changes, in addition to the regression test cases, new test cases must be written.\n\n### Intention-Based Classification\n\nAccording to ISO/IEC 14764, the categories of software maintenance are:\n\n*   Corrective\n*   Adaptive\n*   Perfective\n*   Preventive\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n#### Corrective Maintenance\n\nReact to problems that are uncovered. Unplanned (unscheduled) software maintenance is also required to allow the software to function.\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n#### Adaptive Maintenance\n\nMaintain software usability in an ever-changing environment. For example, software modifications may be required as a result of an operating system upgrade.\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n#### Perfective Maintenance\n\nThe goal is to increase user experience, processing efficiency, and maintainability, among other things. For a better user experience, the program outputs can be made more understandable; the program can be updated to make it faster, hence enhancing processing efficiency.\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n#### Preventive Maintenance\n\nAfter-sales modification of a software product to uncover and remedy fundamental flaws before they become operational flaws. For example, with good programming styles, the impact of change is reduced, thereby reducing the number of failures.\n\nSource: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n### Activity-Based Classification\n\nThe intention of an activity depends upon the reason for the change. Two categories: corrections and enhancements.\n\n#### Corrections\n\nThe activities in this category are intended to correct system flaws, which are defined as a difference between the expected and actual behaviour of the system.\n\n|                 | Enhancement | Correction |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- |\n| Proactive       | Perfective  | Preventive |\n| Reactive        | Adaptive    | Corrective |\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n#### Enhancements\n\nDo not necessarily modify the system’s behavior. Categorised into three subcategories as follows:\n\n*   Enhancement activities that modify existing requirements (some) implemented by the system\n*   Enhancement activities that add new system requirements; and\n*   Enhancement activities that change the implementation without modifying the existing requirements of the system.\n\n|                 | Enhancement | Correction |\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- |\n| Proactive       | Perfective  | Preventive |\n| Reactive        | Adaptive    | Corrective |\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n### Evidence-Based Classification\n\n#### Objectives\n\n*   Based on objective evidence, which may be measured by observations and comparisons of software before and after alterations\n*   Select the classification coarseness to reflect a true representative mix of observed activities\n*   Hardware, operating system (OS), organisational processes, design methodology, implementation language, and employees involved in maintenance should all be classified independently of the execution and development environments.\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n#### Classification of Maintenance Activities\n\nThe types of maintenance activities are clustered based on modifications made, detected, or observed on four elements of the system being maintained:\n\n*   The entire software\n*   The external documentation\n*   The properties of the program code\n*   The experience of customer on system functionality.\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n### Support Interface\n\n#### Training\n\nThis refers to informing the stakeholders about the system\'s implementation.\n\n#### Consultive\n\nIn this type, maintenance work is estimated in terms of cost and time, personnel staff a help desk, clients are assisted in preparing maintenance work requests, and personnel share expert knowledge of available resources and the system with others in the company to improve efficiency.\n\n#### Evaluative\n\nReviewing the program code and documentations, assessing the ripple effect of a proposed modification, writing and performing tests, examining the programming support offered by the operating system, and discovering and debugging the required data are all common actions in this kind.\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n### Documentation\n\n#### Reformative\n\nOrdinary actions of this sort include improving the readability of the documentation, aligning it with other system modifications, creating training materials, and adding entries to a data dictionary.\n\n#### Updative\n\nTypical tasks include replacing out-of-date documentation with current documentation, creating semi-formal documentation, such as in UML, to document current programme code, and updating the documentation with test plans.\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n### Software Properties\n\n#### Groomative\n\nSubstituting more efficient and simpler components and algorithms, updating data naming standards, changing access authorizations, compiling source code, and performing backups are all common actions in this category. Ordinary preventive efforts of this type make improvements to improve maintainability and lay the groundwork for a future transition to an emerging technology. Performance activities provide results that have an influence on the user. These operations increase system uptime by replacing slower components and algorithms. Ordinary Adaptive actions of this sort migrate software to a new execution platform and increase the use of COTS components.\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n### Business Rules\n\n#### Reductive\n\nOrdinary operations of this sort reduce the amount of data input to the system and reduce the amount of data created by the system.\n\n#### Corrective\n\nCorrecting detected flaws, implementing defensive programming strategies, and changing the way exceptions are handled are all common actions in this category.\n\n#### Enhancive\n\nAdding and changing business rules to improve the system\'s functionality available to the client, as well as adding new data flows into or out of the software, are typical tasks in this category.\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014). Software Evolution and Maintenance – A Practitioner’s Approach. John Wiley and Son. Springer Vieweg.\n\n### Evidence-Based Maintenance Activities\n\nSource from: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014).

Most of these expenses come from making enhancements or updates to the software rather than fixing errors.\n\n### Impact Analysis\n\nOne major challenge in maintaining software is understanding how changes will affect the rest of the system. Impact analysis helps assess the possible outcomes of a modification, aiming to minimize unexpected problems. This process includes checking if the proposed change is correct, evaluating risks, and estimating how it will impact system performance and development.\n\n### Corrective Changes\n\nCorrective changes can be tricky because it\'s often hard to identify where exactly changes need to be made in the code. Recognizing the relevant parts of the codebase can be difficult. Even small modifications might require significant changes to the software\'s structure, which can be time-consuming. If a workaround has already been implemented for a problem, fixing new issues can become even more complicated. Repairing design flaws is challenging since it requires a deep understanding of the entire codebase and comes with risks.\n\n### Adaptive Changes\n\nAdaptive changes, which involve updating the software to work with new technologies, can also be hard. Sometimes, there\'s not enough information about what the software needs to change to. Understanding new technologies and how to integrate them can be difficult. Additionally, issues may arise from a lack of proper initial design.\n\n### Program Comprehension\n\nProgram comprehension is another important aspect. Maintenance engineers often spend a lot of time reading and understanding the code and documentation to grasp the logic, purpose, and structure of the software. This understanding is crucial for effectively maintaining and improving the quality of the software.\n\n## IEEE Maintenance Process (IEEE 1219)\n\nSource: Tripathy, P., Naik K. (2014).

As a result, all changes must be compatible with the existing software architecture, design, and code limitations.\\n\\n#### Shorter Time Frame\\nMaintenance activities might last anywhere from a few hours to many months, but software creation can take up to a year.\\n\\n#### Available Test Data\\nTest cases are created from scratch during software development, however software maintenance can choose a portion of these test cases and run them as regression tests. As a result, selecting acceptable test cases from the existing test suite is a hurdle. To effectively test the code changes, in addition to the regression test cases, new test cases must be written.\\n\\n### Intention-Based Classification\\n\\nAccording to ISO\\/IEC 14764, the categories of software maintenance are:\\n\\n#### Corrective Maintenance\\nReact to problems that are uncovered. Unplanned (unscheduled) software maintenance is also required to allow the software to function.\\n\\n#### Adaptive Maintenance\\nMaintain software usability in an ever-changing environment. For example, software modifications may be required as a result of an operating system upgrade.\\n\\n#### Perfective Maintenance\\nThe goal is to increase user experience, processing efficiency, and maintainability, among other things. For a better user experience, the program outputs can be made more understandable; the program can be updated to make it faster, hence enhancing processing efficiency.\\n\\n#### Preventive Maintenance\\nAfter-sales modification of a software product to uncover and remedy fundamental flaws before they become operational flaws. For example, with good programming styles, the impact of change is reduced, thereby reducing the number of failures.\\n\\n### Activity-Based Classification\\n\\nThe intention of an activity depends upon the reason for the change. Two categories: corrections and enhancements.\\n\\n#### Corrections\\nThe activities in this category are intended to correct system flaws, which are defined as a difference between the expected and actual behaviour of the system.\\n\\n|                 | Enhancement | Correction |\\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- |\\n| Proactive       | Perfective  | Preventive |\\n| Reactive        | Adaptive    | Corrective |\\n\\n#### Enhancements\\nDo not necessarily modify the system’s behavior. Categorised into three subcategories as follows:\\n\\n#### Enhancement Type 1\\nEnhancement activities that modify existing requirements (some) implemented by the system\\n\\n#### Enhancement Type 2\\nEnhancement activities that add new system requirements\\n\\n#### Enhancement Type 3\\nEnhancement activities that change the implementation without modifying the existing requirements of the system.\\n\\n|                 | Enhancement | Correction |\\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- |\\n| Proactive       | Perfective  | Preventive |\\n| Reactive        | Adaptive    | Corrective |\\n\\n### Evidence-Based Classification\\n\\n#### Objectives\\n*Based on objective evidence, which may be measured by observations and comparisons of software before and after alterations*\\n*Select the classification coarseness to reflect a true representative mix of observed activities*\\n*Hardware, operating system (OS), organisational processes, design methodology, implementation language, and employees involved in maintenance should all be classified independently of the execution and development environments.*\\n\\n#### Classification of Maintenance Activities\\nThe types of maintenance activities are clustered based on modifications made, detected, or observed on four elements of the system being maintained:\\n\\n#### Entire Software\\nThe entire software\\n\\n#### External Documentation\\nThe external documentation\\n\\n#### Program Code Properties\\nThe properties of the program code\\n\\n#### Customer Experience\\nThe experience of customer on system functionality.\\n\\n### Support Interface\\n\\n#### Training\\nThis refers to informing the stakeholders about the system\'s implementation.\\n\\n#### Consultive\\nIn this type, maintenance work is estimated in terms of cost and time, personnel staff a help desk, clients are assisted in preparing maintenance work requests, and personnel share expert knowledge of available resources and the system with others in the company to improve efficiency.\\n\\n#### Evaluative\\nReviewing the program code and documentations, assessing the ripple effect of a proposed modification, writing and performing tests, examining the programming support offered by the operating system, and discovering and debugging the required data are all common actions in this kind.\\n\\n### Documentation\\n\\n#### Reformative\\nOrdinary actions of this sort include improving the readability of the documentation, aligning it with other system modifications, creating training materials, and adding entries to a data dictionary.\\n\\n#### Updative\\nTypical tasks include replacing out-of-date documentation with current documentation, creating semi-formal documentation, such as in UML, to document current programme code, and updating the documentation with test plans.\\n\\n### Software Properties\\n\\n#### Groomative\\nSubstituting more efficient and simpler components and algorithms, updating data naming standards, changing access authorizations, compiling source code, and performing backups are all common actions in this category. Ordinary preventive efforts of this type make improvements to improve maintainability and lay the groundwork for a future transition to an emerging technology. Performance activities provide results that have an influence on the user. These operations increase system uptime by replacing slower components and algorithms. Ordinary Adaptive actions of this sort migrate software to a new execution platform and increase the use of COTS components.\\n\\n### Business Rules\\n\\n#### Reductive\\nOrdinary operations of this sort reduce the amount of data input to the system and reduce the amount of data created by the system.\\n\\n#### Corrective\\nCorrecting detected flaws, implementing defensive programming strategies, and changing the way exceptions are handled are all common actions in this category.\\n\\n#### Enhancive\\nAdding and changing business rules to improve the system\'s functionality available to the client, as well as adding new data flows into or out of the software, are typical tasks in this category.\\n\\n### Evidence-Based Maintenance Activities\\n\\n### Evidence-Based Classification: Decision Tree-Based Criteria\\n\\n## Issues and Challenges in Software Maintenance\\n\\n### Costs\\nSoftware maintenance is a big part of the overall development process, consuming between 60% and 80% of total costs. Most of these expenses come from making enhancements or updates to the software rather than fixing errors.\\n\\n### Impact Analysis\\nOne major challenge in maintaining software is understanding how changes will affect the rest of the system. Impact analysis helps assess the possible outcomes of a modification, aiming to minimize unexpected problems. This process includes checking if the proposed change is correct, evaluating risks, and estimating how it will impact system performance and development.\\n\\n### Corrective Changes\\nCorrective changes can be tricky because it\'s often hard to identify where exactly changes need to be made in the code. Recognizing the relevant parts of the codebase can be difficult. Even small modifications might require significant changes to the software\'s structure, which can be time-consuming. If a workaround has already been implemented for a problem, fixing new issues can become even more complicated. Repairing design flaws is challenging since it requires a deep understanding of the entire codebase and comes with risks.\\n\\n### Adaptive Changes\\nAdaptive changes, which involve updating the software to work with new technologies, can also be hard. Sometimes, there\'s not enough information about what the software needs to change to. Understanding new technologies and how to integrate them can be difficult. Additionally, issues may arise from a lack of proper initial design.\\n\\n### Program Comprehension\\nProgram comprehension is another important aspect. Maintenance engineers often spend a lot of time reading and understanding the code and documentation to grasp the logic, purpose, and structure of the software. This understanding is crucial for effectively maintaining and improving the quality of the software.\\n\\n## IEEE Maintenance Process (IEEE 1219)\\n\\n*   Problem Identification & Classification\\n*   Request\\n*   Analysis\\n*   Design\\n*   Implementation\\n*   System Test\\n*   Acceptance Test\\n*   Delivery\\n\\n### IEEE Maintenance Process Attributes\\n\\nEach of the seven activities have five associated attributes as follows:\\n\\n#### Activity Definition\\nThis refers to the implementation process of the activity.\\n\\n#### Input\\nThis refers to the items that are required as input to the activity.\\n\\n#### Output\\nThis refers to the items that are produced by the activity.\\n\\n#### Control\\nThis refers to those items that provide control over the activity.\\n\\n#### Metrics\\nThis refers to the items that are measured during the execution of the activity.\\n\\n## ISO\\/IEC 14764 Maintenance Process\\n\\n### ISO\\/IEC 14764 Maintenance Process High-Level Activities\\n\\nThe maintenance process comprises the following high-level activities:\\n\\n1.

Quick fix model\\n2.  Iterative enhancement model\\n3.  Full reuse model\\n\\n### Reuse-Oriented Models\\nAssumes that existing components can be re-used in software maintenance. It consists of the following steps:\\n\\n*   Identifying the components of the old system which can be reused\\n*   Understanding these components\\n*   Modifying the old system components so that they can be used in the new system\\n*   Integrating the modified components into the new system.\\n\\n#### Quick Fix Model\\n\\n##### Quick Fix Model Description\\n*   Necessary changes are quickly made to the code and then to the accompanying documentation.\\n*   The new code is recompiled to produce a new version.\\n*   Embodies a commonly used approach to software maintenance.\\n*   Low cost.\\n*   Less concern on the impacts of modifications.\\n\\n#### Iterative Enhancement Model\\n\\n##### Iterative Enhancement Model Description\\n*   Based on the Japanese concept of Kaizen, which stands for the gradual and systematic enhancement of procedures.\\n*   First changes are made to the highest level documents.\\n*   Eventually, changes are propagated down to the code level.\\n*   Assumes complete documentation is available.\\n*   It begins with the existing system’s artifacts, namely, requirements, design, code, test, and analysis documents.\\n*   It revises the highest-level documents affected by the changes and propagates the changes down through the lower-level documents.\\n*   The model allows maintainers to redesign the system, based on the analysis of the existing system.\\n*   Also accommodates the quick fix model.\\n\\nThree stages cycle:\\n\\n*   Analysis of software system.\\n*   Classification of requested modifications.\\n*   Implementation of requested modifications.\\n\\n#### Full Reuse Model\\n*   A new system is built from components of the old system and others available in the repository.\\n*   The main assumption in this model is the availability of a repository of artifacts describing the earlier versions of the present and similar systems.\\n\\n##### Full Reuse Model Activities\\n\\nFull reuse comprises two major steps:\\n\\n1.  Perform requirement analysis and design of the new system.\\n2.  Use the appropriate artifacts, such as requirements, design, code, and test from any earlier versions of the old system.\\n\\nThe following activities are performed:\\n\\n*   Identify the components of the old system that are candidates for reuse.\\n*   Understand the identified system components.\\n*   Modify the old system components to support the new requirements.\\n*   Integrate the modified components to form the newly developed system.\\n\\n### Other Models\\n\\n*   Boehm\'s Model\\n*   Taute Maintenance Model.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1.

Impact analysis helps assess the possible outcomes of a modification, aiming to minimize unexpected problems. This process includes checking if the proposed change is correct, evaluating risks, and estimating how it will impact system performance and development.*\\n\\n### Corrective Changes\\n\\n*Corrective changes can be tricky because it\'s often hard to identify where exactly changes need to be made in the code. Recognizing the relevant parts of the codebase can be difficult. Even small modifications might require significant changes to the software\'s structure, which can be time-consuming. If a workaround has already been implemented for a problem, fixing new issues can become even more complicated. Repairing design flaws is challenging since it requires a deep understanding of the entire codebase and comes with risks.*\\n\\n### Adaptive Changes\\n\\n*Adaptive changes, which involve updating the software to work with new technologies, can also be hard. Sometimes, there\'s not enough information about what the software needs to change to. Understanding new technologies and how to integrate them can be difficult. Additionally, issues may arise from a lack of proper initial design.*\\n\\n### Program Comprehension\\n\\n*Program comprehension is another important aspect. Maintenance engineers often spend a lot of time reading and understanding the code and documentation to grasp the logic, purpose, and structure of the software. This understanding is crucial for effectively maintaining and improving the quality of the software.*\\n\\n## IEEE Maintenance Process (IEEE 1219)\\n\\nSource: Tripathy, P., Naik K.

This is achieved without adding or deleting information, but rather by modifying existing information.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4.6 Models of Software Re-Engineering\r\n\r\n### 4.6.1 General Model\r\n\r\n*   *(No specific details provided in the source content for this section.)*\r\n\r\n### 4.6.2 Horse Shoe Model\r\n\r\n*   **Description:** This model conceptualizes re-engineering as a cyclical process divided into three main stages:\r\n    1.  **Reverse Engineering:** Analyzing and understanding existing code, often necessary when original documentation is lacking or the technology is obsolete.\r\n    2.  **Software Reorganization (Software Restructuring):** Improving specific components of the system based on the understanding gained from reverse engineering. This stage involves modifications and restructuring.\r\n    3.  **Forward Engineering:** Designing and implementing a new, improved system based on the restructured model derived from the previous stages.\r\n\r\n*   **Formula:** Reengineering = Reverse engineering + Δ + Forward engineering\r\n    *   \"Δ\" represents the **alterations** made to the original system during the process.\r\n    *   These alterations can be categorized along two major dimensions:\r\n        *   **Change in Functionality:** Modifying or adding features.\r\n        *   **Change in Implementation Technique:** Adopting new languages, algorithms, or architectural styles.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4.7 Changes on Characteristics of System\r\n\r\nFour distinct groups of changes can be made to a system\'s characteristics during re-engineering:\r\n\r\n*   **Recode:**\r\n    *   **Focus:** Alters implementation properties by rewriting the source program.\r\n    *   **Method:** Involves rephrasing and program translation at the source code level.\r\n    *   **Example:** Translating COBOL code to Java.\r\n\r\n*   **Redesign:**\r\n    *   **Focus:** Modifies the software\'s architectural or structural design.\r\n    *   **Common Changes:**\r\n        *   Restructuring the system\'s architecture.\r\n        *   Modifying the data model and storage mechanisms.\r\n        *   Replacing inefficient algorithms or procedures with more efficient ones.\r\n\r\n*   **Respecify:**\r\n    *   **Focus:** Modifies the system\'s required characteristics.\r\n    *   **Methods:**\r\n        *   Changing the *form* of the requirements (e.g., from informal text to formal specifications).\r\n        *   Changing the *scope* of the requirements (e.g., adding new features or removing existing ones).\r\n\r\n*   **Rethink:**\r\n    *   **Focus:** Fundamentally alters the concepts embodied by the system.\r\n    *   **Description:** This is the most profound change, where the system is rebuilt to address a different challenge or problem entirely. It alters the system\'s core conceptual properties.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4.8 Software Re-Engineering Strategies\r\n\r\nThese strategies define how the principles of abstraction, alteration, and refinement are applied:\r\n\r\n*   **Rewrite Strategy:**\r\n    *   **Principle Applied:** Primarily **alteration**.\r\n    *   **Description:** An operational system is converted into a new system while maintaining the *same degree of abstraction* as the original.\r\n    *   **Example:** Rewriting a legacy Fortran application entirely in the C language, preserving the original logic and structure but changing the code.\r\n\r\n*   **Rework Strategy:**\r\n    *   **Principles Applied:** All three: **abstraction, alteration, and refinement**.\r\n    *   **Description:**\r\n        1.  Uses **abstraction** to create a less detailed representation (e.g., a design model).\r\n        2.  **Alters** this rebuilt system model without changing its abstraction level.\r\n        3.  Uses **refinement** to produce an acceptable new system representation at a lower level of abstraction (e.g., code).\r\n\r\n*   **Replace Strategy:**\r\n    *   **Principles Applied:** **Abstraction and refinement**.\r\n    *   **Description:**\r\n        1.  Hides implementation details (uses **abstraction**) to reconstruct the system at a higher abstraction level (e.g., a conceptual or requirements model).\r\n        2.  Applies **refinement** to form an appropriate representation for the target system at a lower degree of abstraction (e.g., design or code).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4.9 Reengineering Process Variation\r\n\r\nThis framework helps determine if a target system can be produced based on the starting abstraction level, the type of changes desired, and the strategy employed.\r\n\r\n*   **Possible Outcomes:**\r\n    *   **Yes:** A target system can be successfully produced.\r\n    *   **Yes\\*:** Similar to \"Yes,\" but the starting abstraction level is lower than the highest conceptual abstraction level (meaning you\'re starting from a point of less detail than ideally possible for maximum conceptual understanding).\r\n    *   **No:** The starting abstraction level is too high to make the desired changes using the selected strategy.\r\n    *   **Bad:** A target system can be created, but the probability of achieving a high-quality or successful result is low.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4.10 Re-Engineering Approaches\r\n\r\nThese approaches categorize re-engineering based on two aspects:\r\n1.  **Extent of re-engineering:** How much of the system is touched.\r\n2.  **Rate of substitution:** How quickly the old system is replaced by the new one.\r\n\r\n### 4.10.1 Big Bang Approach\r\n\r\n*   **Description:** The entire system is replaced simultaneously. The re-engineering project is completed entirely before the new system is deployed.\r\n*   **When Used:** Adopted when a gradual, part-by-part reengineering is not feasible or practical.\r\n*   **Risks:** High risk due to a single, large-scale deployment.\r\n\r\n### 4.10.2 Incremental Approach\r\n\r\n*   **Description:** The system is reengineered in small, sequential steps. Each step brings the system closer to the target state.\r\n*   **Benefits:**\r\n    *   **Easier Mistake Detection:** Errors are localized to specific new components, making them easier to find and fix.\r\n    *   **Client Visibility:** Clients can see progress through intermediate, functional versions.\r\n    *   **Reduced Risk:** Less risky than the \"Big Bang\" approach due to smaller deployments.\r\n*   **Disadvantages:**\r\n    *   **Longer Completion Time:** Multiple interim versions and careful version management extend the overall project duration.\r\n    *   **Architectural Limitations:** May not allow for fundamental changes to the entire system\'s architecture if such changes require a complete overhaul.\r\n\r\n### 4.10.3 Partial Approach\r\n\r\n*   **Description:** Only a specific portion of the system is reengineered, and this reengineered part is then integrated with the remaining, un-reengineered parts of the original system.\r\n*   **Steps:**\r\n    1.  Divide the existing system into two parts: one to be reengineered and one to remain unchanged.\r\n    2.  Apply either the \"Big Bang\" or \"Incremental\" approach to the chosen part.\r\n    3.  Integrate the reengineered part with the original part to form the new system.\r\n\r\n### 4.10.4 Iterative Approach\r\n\r\n*   **Description:** Re-engineering is performed on small pieces of the source code (e.g., a few procedures) in short, repeated cycles. This process is then applied to multiple components over different stages.\r\n*   **Focus:** Fine-grained changes and continuous improvement.\r\n\r\n### 4.10.5 Evolutionary Approach\r\n\r\n*   **Description:** Similar to the \"Incremental\" approach, where components of the original system are gradually replaced with reengineered counterparts.\r\n*   **Process:** Existing components are grouped by function, and then reengineered into new, improved components. The system evolves over time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4.11 Source Code Reengineering Reference Model (SCORE/RM)\r\n\r\n*   **Purpose:** An approach designed to:\r\n    *   Understand the software\'s intrinsic needs.\r\n    *   **Rationalize** the system by removing redundancy and optimizing control flow.\r\n    *   Rebuild the software adhering to best practices.\r\n\r\n*   **Key Elements:**\r\n    *   Functions\r\n    *   Database repository\r\n    *   Documentation\r\n    *   Metrication (measurement and analysis)\r\n\r\n*   **SCORE-RM Processes (Overview):** Involves steps like analyzing code, parsing it, transforming it, rationalizing control flow, isolating components, normalizing data, compressing data, and interpreting code to understand its logic and structure.\r\n\r\n*   **Abstraction in SCORE-RM (Overview):** Focuses on identifying object hierarchies, separating data from its operators, grouping related operators, interpreting objects, understanding causation, specifying software constraints, regenerating designs, and ultimately creating code and test cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4.12 Code Reverse Engineering\r\n\r\n*   **Definition:** The process of:\r\n    *   Identifying and defining the constituent components of an operational software system.\r\n    *   Defining the interactions and relationships between these components.\r\n    *   Representing the system at a higher level of abstraction or in a different, more understandable form.\r\n    *   Essentially, it\'s about extracting information from existing software artifacts and converting it into abstract models that are easier for maintenance personnel to comprehend.\r\n\r\n*   **Factors Necessitating Reverse Engineering:**\r\n    *   **Loss of Expertise:** Original developers have left the organization.\r\n    *   **Obsolete Technology:** The implementation language or platform is no longer supported.\r\n    *   **Poor Documentation:** Insufficient or outdated documentation makes understanding difficult.\r\n    *   **Business Criticality:** Core business functions rely on poorly understood legacy software.\r\n    *   **Acquisition Issues:** Acquired systems may lack complete source code or documentation.\r\n    *   **Adaptation/Enhancement Needs:** The system requires modifications or improvements beyond its current capabilities.\r\n    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** The software does not function as expected, requiring investigation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4.13 Reverse Engineering Techniques\r\n\r\nThese techniques are employed to analyze and understand source code:\r\n\r\n### 4.13.1 Lexical Analysis\r\n\r\n*   **Process:** Breaking down a sequence of source code characters into its smallest meaningful units, called *lexical units* or *tokens*.\r\n*   **Purpose:** Enables various representations of program data and is often the first step in understanding code structure.\r\n*   **Example Output:** A cross-reference list of identifiers and their uses.\r\n*   **Tool:** A lexical analyzer (often part of a compiler).\r\n\r\n### 4.13.2 Syntactic Analysis\r\n\r\n*   **Process:** The parser checks if the sequence of tokens produced by lexical analysis conforms to the grammar rules of the programming language. It builds a parse tree or abstract syntax tree.\r\n*   **Method:** Uses context-free grammars, often defined using Backus-Naur Form (BNF).\r\n*   **Example Tool:** YACC (Yet Another Compiler Compiler) can generate parsers from language grammar descriptions.\r\n\r\n### 4.13.3 Control Flow Analysis\r\n\r\n*   **Focus:** Understanding the order in which statements are executed.\r\n\r\n*   **Types:**\r\n    *   **Intra-procedural Analysis:**\r\n        *   **Description:** Analyzes execution paths *within a single subprogram* (function, procedure).\r\n        *   **Representation:** Control Flow Graphs (CFGs), where nodes are statements or basic blocks, and edges represent possible transfers of control.\r\n    *   **Inter-procedural Analysis:**\r\n        *   **Description:** Analyzes the calling relationships *between different subprograms*.\r\n        *   **Representation:** Call Graphs, where nodes are subprograms, and directed edges indicate that one subprogram calls another.\r\n\r\n### 4.13.4 Data Flow Analysis (DFA)\r\n\r\n*   **Focus:** Tracing how the values of variables are defined, propagated, and used throughout a program.\r\n*   **Purpose:**\r\n    *   Detects potential loops and data flow anomalies.\r\n    *   Identifies code that can never be executed.\r\n    *   Finds variables used before they are assigned a value.\r\n    *   Helps pinpoint statements that might need alteration when fixing bugs.\r\n\r\n### 4.13.5 Program Slicing\r\n\r\n*   **Definition:** A program slice is a subset of a program that preserves the execution behavior of the original program concerning a specific criterion, but is potentially smaller. It helps isolate parts of the program relevant to a particular computation.\r\n\r\n*   **Types:**\r\n    *   **Backward Slice:**\r\n        *   **Criterion:** A specific variable `v` at a particular program point `p`.\r\n        *   **What it includes:** All instructions and predicates that *affect* the value of `v` at point `p`.\r\n        *   **Answers:** \"What parts of the program might have influenced this value?\"\r\n    *   **Forward Slicing:**\r\n        *   **Criterion:** A specific variable `v` at a particular program point `p`.\r\n        *   **What it includes:** All instructions and predicates whose values *depend on* the value of `v` at point `p`.\r\n        *   **Answers:** \"What parts of the program might be affected by this value?\"\r\n\r\n---', '2025-11-14 16:30:07'),

The research aims to address the gap in understanding how summary length affects sentiment preservation, particularly comparing extractive and abstractive summarization methods.

While the course structure includes coursework and an exam, it also delves into concepts like DevOps, a methodology emphasizing collaboration and automation between development and operations teams, which aims to improve the efficiency and appeal of software maintenance by fostering a \"you build it, you own it\" philosophy and integrating maintenance into the overall DevOps lifecycle.', '2025-11-14 14:21:36'),

This process involves proactive and reactive measures to fix issues, adapt to environmental changes, enhance functionality, and prevent future problems. Maintenance operates under constraints of existing systems, often with shorter timeframes than initial development, and faces challenges in selecting appropriate test data. Maintenance activities are classified based on their intention (corrective, adaptive, perfective, preventive) and the nature of the changes (corrections and enhancements), with evidence-based classifications also considering observable modifications. Standardized processes like the IEEE Maintenance Process and ISO/IEC 14764 outline structured approaches, while various maintenance models, including reuse-oriented ones, guide how these activities are performed, addressing significant challenges like cost, impact analysis, and program comprehension.', '2025-11-15 09:04:48'),
(97, 41, 'Software Maintenance Overview', 'Software maintenance encompasses a range of activities aimed at keeping software operational and evolving. Key characteristics include monitoring daily operations, controlling changes, improving current functions, fixing security vulnerabilities, and preventing performance degradation. Maintenance is unique due to its operational context, requiring compatibility with existing systems, and often operates within shorter timeframes compared to initial development, with challenges in selecting appropriate test data.\n\nClassifications of software maintenance are broadly categorized by intention, activity, and evidence. Intention-based classification, as defined by ISO/IEC 14764, includes corrective (fixing problems), adaptive (adapting to environmental changes), perfective (improving user experience and efficiency), and preventive (addressing flaws before they manifest). Activity-based classification further divides these into corrections and enhancements, differentiating between proactive and reactive approaches.\n\nEvidence-based classification focuses on objective measurements of software changes, considering factors like hardware, operating systems, and organizational processes. This approach clusters activities based on modifications to the entire software, documentation, code properties, or user experience. Support interfaces, such as training and consultative services, are also crucial, as are documentation activities like reformative (improving readability) and updative (replacing outdated information) efforts.\n\nSoftware properties and business rules also inform maintenance classifications. Groomative activities improve system maintainability and performance, while reductive actions aim to decrease data input or output. Corrective business rule maintenance fixes detected flaws, and enhancive activities add or change rules to expand functionality. These classifications are often aided by decision trees to guide the maintenance process.\n\nDespite its importance, software maintenance presents significant challenges. It constitutes a substantial portion of overall software costs, with enhancements being a major driver. Impact analysis is crucial but complex, and corrective and adaptive changes can be difficult due to code complexity and evolving technologies. Program comprehension remains a vital skill for maintenance engineers, who often dedicate considerable time to understanding existing codebases. Standardized processes like the IEEE and ISO/IEC maintenance models provide structured frameworks for managing these activities.', '2025-11-15 09:38:27');
