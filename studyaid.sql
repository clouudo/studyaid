(706, 37, 'e Costs and Design)\n*   Maintenance costs increase significantly in later life cycle stages, necessitating meticulous software engineering.\n*   Disciplined change control and testing are critical to mitigate system degradation from modifications.\n*   Conducting impact analysis is essential to limit unintended consequences.\n*   Designing maintainability into software helps make modifications manageable.\n*   Maintenance cost estimation should begin early in development planning, using historical data as a baseline.\n*   Estimates are refined with project progression and additional information.\n*   Categorizing costs reveals resource allocation, with most expenditures on enhancements rather than repairs.\n\n### Definition – Software Maintenance\n*   “The process of

(709, 37, ' DevOps\n\n*   DevOps is a software development methodology that streamlines the delivery of high-performance applications by integrating and automating the work of development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams, which traditionally functioned in silos. It promotes collaboration and coordination between these teams.\n*   Key features of DevOps include continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), allowing for smaller, faster software updates through frequent merging, testing, and deployment of new code. This approach evolves from agile software development, which emphasizes iterative processes over the traditional waterfall model that involves lengthy development and testing phases.\n*   Ultimately,

The objective is to create a prioritized backlog of features, improvements, and bug fixes.\n\n#### Coding\n*   The DevOps team develops features from the backlog using common practices like test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and peer code reviews. Code is initially written and tested on local workstations before advancing in the continuous delivery pipeline.\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n#### Building\n*   New code is integrated into the existing code base, then tested and packaged for release.

(714, 37, 'e DevOps arena. Coding continues to be celebrated as the most exciting aspect of work within this field. While DevOps has succeeded in connecting those who code with those who maintain, it hasn’t yet made maintenance itself a more attractive aspect of the job.\n*   This perception may need to evolve. Organizations that are ahead of the curve should acknowledge that software maintenance—which encompasses activities like applying updates, monitoring applications, and scaling infrastructure—is just as critical for ensuring a smooth application experience as the software itself. This recognition should be explicitly integrated into the DevOps approach.\n*   Source: https://devops.com/making-software-maintenance-cool-devops/\n\n## References\n\n*   Blokdyk. G. ((2020).

stakeholder and market needs.\n*   Supporting additional functionalities, improving system performance, and allowing the system to run on a different operating system are among the goals.\n*   Essentially, as time passes, stakeholders and users have a better understanding of the system.\n*   “Over time, what evolves is not the software but our knowledge about a particular type of software”- Mehdi Jazayeri\n\n### 1.4 Importance of Software Evolution\n\n*   Ensuring that the software product remains relevant and competitive.\n*   Enhances the overall user experience.\n*   Regular upgrades

(944, 2000000043, 'Commercial Off-The-Shelf) software involves addressing various factors such as system obsolescence, technology updates, source code escrow, and vendor license management, among other related aspects.\n*   Programmatic considerations highlight the challenges of categorizing sustainment needs as “minor requirements.”\n*   The transition to a sustainment phase examines elements like support database migration, the infrastructure for development and software support (including software testing labs, hardware spare parts, and procedures for releases), workforce needs, training

software engineering.\n*   Disciplined change control and testing are critical to mitigate system degradation from modifications.\n*   Conducting impact analysis is essential to limit unintended consequences.\n*   Designing maintainability into software helps make modifications manageable.\n*   Maintenance cost estimation should begin early in development planning, using historical data as a baseline.\n*   Estimates are refined with project progression and additional information.\n*   Categorizing costs reveals resource allocation, with most expenditures on enhancements rather than

It promotes collaboration and coordination between these teams.\n*   Key features of DevOps include continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), allowing for smaller, faster software updates through frequent merging, testing, and deployment of new code.

(958, 2000000043, 'evOps not only offers better organisational support for software maintenance but also enhances communication between developers and operations teams, leading to more effective maintenance strategies.\n*   A fundamental principle of DevOps is the \"you build it, you own it\" philosophy, which asserts that the developers who create code are also responsible for its deployment and ongoing maintenance. Even if the organisation doesn’t fully embrace this principle, it likely fosters increased collaboration between developers and IT operations. Consequently, when production issues arise or upgrades are necessary for maintaining reliability, developers are actively involved in resolving these matters.\n    *   Source:

Coding continues to be celebrated as the most exciting aspect of work within this field. While DevOps has succeeded in connecting those who code with those who maintain, it hasn’t yet made maintenance itself a more attractive aspect of the job.\n*   This perception may need to evolve. Organizations that are ahead of the curve should acknowledge that software maintenance—which encompasses activities like applying updates, monitoring applications, and scaling infrastructure—is just as critical for ensuring a smooth application experience as the software itself.

(967, 2000000044, 'e: Determining RPO\n\n*   Determine that a loss of a maximum of 800 records is acceptable for your application.\n*   Use existing patterns to determine that no more than 100 records are created an hour.\n*   Calculate that an RPO of 8 hours (8\\*100 records) is acceptable.\n*   Based on this information, if a disaster occurred at 10 p.m., the system should be able to recover all data that was in the system before 2 p.m.\n\n### Determining RTO (Recovery Time Objective)\n\nRTO is the maximum acceptable amount of time after a disaster strikes that a business process can remain out of commission.

Overlooking these challenges may jeopardize the stability, improvement, and lifespan of systems in operation.\n*   Life-cycle sustainment factors involve supply, maintenance, transportation, sustaining engineering, data management, configuration management, Human Systems Integration (HSI), environmental and occupational health and safety (including explosives safety), protection of essential program information and anti-tamper measures, supportability, and interoperability.\n\n### Definition - Software Sustainment\n*   “The processes, procedures, people, material, and information required to support, maintain, and operate the software aspects of a system.” - SEI Working Definition\n\n### Criteria to Enter Software Sustainment (Lapham & Sei, 2014)\n*   **Stable software production baseline**—Sustainment organizations typically require software to be stable before they will accept it for ongoing maintenance.\n*   **Complete and current software documentation**—Having thorough and up-to-date software documentation is essential for the software sustainment team.\n*   **Authority to Operate (ATO) for an operational software system**—An Authority to Operate must be granted before any software system can be deemed operational in the field and eligible for sustainment.\n*   **Current and negotiated Sustainment Transition Plan**—Often, a program may have been developed, tested, and deemed operational, yet there may be no allocated funding for the creation and negotiation of the Sustainment Transition Plan.\n*   **Sustainment staffing and training plan**—It is crucial to properly staff the sustainment organization. The team should consist of trained software professionals who can collaborate with the development organization to ensure the necessary system knowledge is transferred.\n\n### Challenges of Sustainment (Lapham & Sei, 2014)\n*   Sustaining COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) software involves addressing various factors such as system obsolescence, technology updates, source code escrow, and vendor license management, among other related aspects.\n*   Programmatic considerations highlight the challenges of categorizing sustainment needs as “minor requirements.”\n*   The transition to a sustainment phase examines elements like support database migration, the infrastructure for development and software support (including software testing labs, hardware spare parts, and procedures for releases), workforce needs, training for operations, and planning for the transition.\n*   User support covers topics such as help desk services, user manuals, and training for users.\n*   Information assurance addresses the specific challenges associated with IA in relation to COTS software products and the testing required for IA.\n\n### Software Maintenance - Basic Concepts\n*   Software maintenance is essential to ensure the long-term viability of software products throughout their lifecycle. i.e. from conception to completion.\n*   Changes to the software product are documented, the effects (impacts) of the changes are discovered, artefacts are modified, testing is performed, and a new software release is prepared.\n*   Users are educated, and assistance is available at all times.\n*   The term \"maintainer\" refers to a company or organisation that provides maintenance work.\n    *   Source: http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance\n\n### Basic Concepts (Software Maintenance)\n*   Software maintenance aims to update and improve existing software efficiently while maintaining its integrity.\n*   It ensures that the software continues to function throughout its lifespan, adapts to changing user needs, and addresses issues that arise after deployment.\n*   The main objective is to extend the software’s useful life and postpone the need for replacement. Maintenance engineering uses established software engineering principles to systematically update operational software.\n*   Rigorous change management and regression testing prevent quality from declining. Additionally, maintenance offers ongoing user support, training, and monitors satisfaction.\n\n### Basic Concepts (Software Maintenance Costs and Design)\n*   Maintenance costs increase significantly in later life cycle stages, necessitating meticulous software engineering.\n*   Disciplined change control and testing are critical to mitigate system degradation from modifications.\n*   Conducting impact analysis is essential to limit unintended consequences.\n*   Designing maintainability into software helps make modifications manageable.\n*   Maintenance cost estimation should begin early in development planning, using historical data as a baseline.\n*   Estimates are refined with project progression and additional information.\n*   Categorizing costs reveals resource allocation, with most expenditures on enhancements rather than repairs.\n\n### Definition – Software Maintenance\n*   “The process of modifying a software system or component after delivery to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environment.” - IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology\n\n### Reasons of Maintenance\n*   Prevent software operation from failure.\n*   Fix discovered software bugs.\n*   Improve software. Eg. to link or access to other new devices.\n*   Ensure software works in different environment (if required).\n*   Provide better experiences to users.\n*   Comply with organizational goal (if changes).\n\n### Software Development vs Software Maintenance\n\n| Feature                 | SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT                                                                    | SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE                                                                                      |\n| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Driver**              | requirements driven                                                                     | event driven                                                                                              |\n| **Process Start**       | Process begins with the objective of designing and implementing a system to deliver certain functional and nonfunctional requirements. | scheduled in response to an event.                                                                        |\n| **Nature of Work**      | Primary/First Implementation.                                                           | on-going administration/support.                                                                          |\n| **Action**              | Development of software from new.                                                       | Modifying or adding new features based on existing software.

It promotes collaboration and coordination between these teams.\n*   Key features of DevOps include continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), allowing for smaller, faster software updates through frequent merging, testing, and deployment of new code. This approach evolves from agile software development, which emphasizes iterative processes over the traditional waterfall model that involves lengthy development and testing phases.\n*   Ultimately, DevOps focuses on meeting user demands for innovative features and consistent performance. - IBM\n\n### DevOps Life-Cycle\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n#### Planning\n*   Teams identify new features and functions for upcoming releases, using user feedback and insights from internal stakeholders like engineers and compliance teams. The objective is to create a prioritized backlog of features, improvements, and bug fixes.\n\n#### Coding\n*   The DevOps team develops features from the backlog using common practices like test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and peer code reviews. Code is initially written and tested on local workstations before advancing in the continuous delivery pipeline.\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n#### Building\n*   New code is integrated into the existing code base, then tested and packaged for release. Automation plays a key role in merging, storing, and compiling code into executable files, with outputs saved in a binary repository for future use.\n\n#### Testing\n*   DevOps teams utilise automated testing throughout the development process, including unit tests during coding and linting after integration. Continuous testing allows for early detection of issues, implementing a \"shift-left\" approach.\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n#### Release\n*   In the final workflow before user access, teams conduct thorough testing to ensure the software meets quality and security standards. Any identified defects are corrected before the application is launched into the production environment, often using automated processes.\n\n#### Deploy\n*   The updated application moves to a production environment, initially deployed to a subset of users to verify stability before a full rollout.\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n#### Operate\n*   DevOps teams ensure new features are functioning correctly with no service interruptions, employing automated tools for continuous monitoring and optimisation of operations.\n\n#### Monitor\n*   Feedback from users and insights from previous workflows are collected to improve future processes and inform planning for the next release of new features.\n*   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n### DevOps Culture\n*   The DevOps culture emphasises collaboration, communication, and automation among all stakeholders involved in software delivery, including development, IT operations, compliance, and security teams.\n*   It requires continuous interaction and shared responsibility to foster innovation and prioritise quality from the outset. At a technical level, DevOps leverages automated tools for testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning to enhance project delivery and minimise errors.\n*   Feedback and measurement are essential for optimising processes and improving software quality. To implement a DevOps culture, organisations often need to dismantle silos and form cross-functional teams that manage projects from start to finish, promoting accountability and collaboration in alignment with agile practices.\n    *   Source: https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/devops\n\n### DevOps and Maintenance\n*   One of the most significant—yet often overlooked—impacts of the DevOps movement is its effort to make software maintenance appealing again. DevOps not only offers better organisational support for software maintenance but also enhances communication between developers and operations teams, leading to more effective maintenance strategies.\n*   A fundamental principle of DevOps is the \"you build it, you own it\" philosophy, which asserts that the developers who create code are also responsible for its deployment and ongoing maintenance. Even if the organisation doesn’t fully embrace this principle, it likely fosters increased collaboration between developers and IT operations. Consequently, when production issues arise or upgrades are necessary for maintaining reliability, developers are actively involved in resolving these matters.\n*   Source: https://devops.com/making-software-maintenance-cool-devops/\n\n### DevOps and Maintenance (Perception and Integration)\n*   Despite the focus on software maintenance in practice, conversations about maintenance tasks remain infrequent in the DevOps arena. Coding continues to be celebrated as the most exciting aspect of work within this field. While DevOps has succeeded in connecting those who code with those who maintain, it hasn’t yet made maintenance itself a more attractive aspect of the job.\n*   This perception may need to evolve. Organizations that are ahead of the curve should acknowledge that software maintenance—which encompasses activities like applying updates, monitoring applications, and scaling infrastructure—is just as critical for ensuring a smooth application experience as the software itself. This recognition should be explicitly integrated into the DevOps approach.\n*   Source: https://devops.com/making-software-maintenance-cool-devops/\n\n## References\n\n*   Blokdyk. G. ((2020).

Overlooking these challenges may jeopardize the stability, improvement, and lifespan of systems in operation.\n*   Life-cycle sustainment factors involve supply, maintenance, transportation, sustaining engineering, data management, configuration management, Human Systems Integration (HSI), environmental and occupational health and safety (including explosives safety), protection of essential program information and anti-tamper measures, supportability, and interoperability.\n\n#### 1.5.1 Definition - Software Sustainment\n\n*   “The processes, procedures, people, material, and information required to support, maintain, and operate the software aspects of a system.” - SEI working Definition\n\n#### 1.5.2 Criteria to Enter Software Sustainment (Lapham & Sei, 2014)\n\n*   Stable software production baseline—Sustainment organizations typically require software to be stable before they will accept it for ongoing maintenance.\n*   Complete and current software documentation—Having thorough and up-to-date software documentation is essential for the software sustainment team.\n*   Authority to Operate (ATO) for an operational software system—An Authority to Operate must be granted before any software system can be deemed operational in the field and eligible for sustainment.\n*   Current and negotiated Sustainment Transition Plan—Often, a program may have been developed, tested, and deemed operational, yet there may be no allocated funding for the creation and negotiation of the Sustainment Transition Plan.\n*   Sustainment staffing and training plan—It is crucial to properly staff the sustainment organization. The team should consist of trained software professionals who can collaborate with the development organization to ensure the necessary system knowledge is transferred.\n\n#### 1.5.3 Challenges of Sustainment (Lapham & Sei, 2014)\n\n*   Sustaining COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) software involves addressing various factors such as system obsolescence, technology updates, source code escrow, and vendor license management, among other related aspects.\n*   Programmatic considerations highlight the challenges of categorizing sustainment needs as “minor requirements.”\n*   The transition to a sustainment phase examines elements like support database migration, the infrastructure for development and software support (including software testing labs, hardware spare parts, and procedures for releases), workforce needs, training for operations, and planning for the transition.\n*   User support covers topics such as help desk services, user manuals, and training for users.\n*   Information assurance addresses the specific challenges associated with IA in relation to COTS software products and the testing required for IA.\n\n### 1.6 Software Maintenance - Basic Concepts\n\n*   Software maintenance is essential to ensure the long-term viability of software products throughout their lifecycle. i.e. from conception to completion.\n*   Changes to the software product are documented, the effects (impacts) of the changes are discovered, artefacts are modified, testing is performed, and a new software release is prepared.\n*   Users are educated, and assistance is available at all times.\n*   The term \"maintainer\" refers to a company or organisation that provides maintenance work.\n    *   Source: [http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance](http://swebokwiki.org/Chapter_5:_Software_Maintenance)\n\n#### 1.6.1 Basic Concepts\n\n*   Software maintenance aims to update and improve existing software efficiently while maintaining its integrity.\n*   It ensures that the software continues to function throughout its lifespan, adapts to changing user needs, and addresses issues that arise after deployment.\n*   The main objective is to extend the software’s useful life and postpone the need for replacement.

Hands-on Labs in this Module\n\n### Guided Lab\n\n*   Configuring Hybrid Storage and Migrating Data with AWS Storage Gateway S3 File Gateway\n\n## 5. Role of a Cloud Architect in Disaster Planning\n\nAs a cloud architect planning for disasters:\n\n*   I need to design architectures that mitigate the risk of disaster, and also support timely recovery from disasters when they occur, so that I can help to minimize the impact of disasters on the business.\n*   I need to consider the organization\'s business needs so I can apply disaster recovery patterns that balance cost, data loss, and recovery time.\n\n## 6. Disaster Planning Strategies\n\n### Failures Can Occur at Any Scale\n\n*   **Small-scale events:** A server stops responding.\n*   **Large-scale events:** Multiple resources across an Availability Zone are unavailable.\n*   **Global events:** Failure is widespread and impacts a large number of users and systems.\n\n### Avoiding and Planning for Disaster\n\n*   **Fault tolerance:** Minimize how often your applications and data become unavailable.\n*   **Backup:** Make sure you have a backup plan for handling data in case of a disaster.\n*   **Disaster recovery:** Recover your data and get your applications back online after a disaster.\n\n### Factors That Influence Disaster Planning Strategies\n\n*   **Time dependency:** How quickly does this need to be remedied to avoid business impact?\n*   **Data loss:** What is the amount of data you are OK with losing? What is the type of data you are OK with losing?\n*   **Geographic location:** Does this impact multiple AWS Regions? Do different Regions require different measurements of how quickly they must recover and how much data loss is OK?\n*   **Cost:** Does the cost represent the correct level considering business impact and risk?\n\n### Determining RPO (Recovery Point Objective)\n\nRPO is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time. How often must your data be backed up?\n\n*(Diagram showing time with \"Last backup\", \"Disaster strikes\", and \"[ data loss ]\" indicating RPO)*\n\n### Example: Determining RPO\n\n*   Determine that a loss of a maximum of 800 records is acceptable for your application.\n*   Use existing patterns to determine that no more than 100 records are created an hour.\n*   Calculate that an RPO of 8 hours (8\\*100 records) is acceptable.\n*   Based on this information, if a disaster occurred at 10 p.m., the system should be able to recover all data that was in the system before 2 p.m.\n\n### Determining RTO (Recovery Time Objective)\n\nRTO is the maximum acceptable amount of time after a disaster strikes that a business process can remain out of commission. How quickly must your applications and data be recovered?\n\n*(Diagram showing time with \"Last backup\", \"Disaster strikes\", \"[ data loss ]\", and \"Applications and data recovered\" indicating RTO)*\n\n### Example: Determining RTO\n\n*   Determine that a ticketing service for a local music venue can be restored within 2 hours.\n*   The business calculates that after 2 hours of an outage, it will begin to lose revenue from lost sales.\n*   Calculate that an RTO of 2 hours is acceptable.\n*   Based on this information, if a disaster occurred at 9 p.m., the system should be returned to service before 11 p.m.\n\n### Preparing a BCP (Business Continuity Plan)\n\nA business continuity plan (BCP) is a system of prevention and recovery from potential threats to a company. A BCP consists of the following:\n\n*   Business impact analysis\n*   Risk assessment\n*   Disaster recovery plan\n*   Evaluated and determined RPO and RTO\n\n### Key Takeaways: Disaster Planning Strategies\n\n*   Failures can occur at any time and on a small, large, or global scale.\n*   A disaster recovery plan will help limit business and customer impact when a disaster occurs.\n*   RPO is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss after an unplanned data-loss incident.\n*   RTO is the amount of time an application, system, and process can be down without causing significant damage to the business.\n*   A BCP is a system of prevention and recovery from potential threats to a company that includes RPO and RTO.\n\n## 7. AWS Disaster Recovery Planning\n\n### DR Plans Span More Than One Region\n\n*(Diagram showing Region 1 and Region 2 with components like Storage, Compute, Database, Management & Governance, Networking & Content Delivery)*\n\n### Storage and Backup Building Blocks\n\n*   **On-premises data center:** Tape, Gateway File gateway, Volume Gateway, DataSync agent, AWS Direct Connect\n*   **AWS Cloud:** AWS DataSync, AWS Storage Gateway, Amazon EBS EBS Volume, Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, Amazon S3, Amazon S3 Glacier\n\n### Configuring Cross-Region Replication\n\n*(Diagram showing AWS Cloud with Region A (Source S3 bucket with replication configured) and Region B (Destination S3 bucket))*\n\n### EBS Volume Snapshots\n\n*(Diagram showing AWS Cloud with Region A (Source EBS volume) and Region B (Copy of snapshot stored in Amazon S3))*\n\n### File System Replication\n\n*(Diagram showing AWS Cloud with Region A (Source Amazon EFS or Amazon FSx) and Region B (Destination Amazon EFS or Amazon FSx), with an optional On-premises data center connection via AWS Direct Connect and AWS DataSync)*\n\n### Recovering Compute Infrastructure\n\nObtain and boot new server instances or containers in minutes.\n\n*   **Custom AMIs (Golden AMIs)**\n*   **Custom container images**\n*   **Auto Scaling group** (EC2 Instance 1, EC2 Instance 2, EC2 Instance 3)\n*   **Amazon Elastic Container Service cluster** (ECS Container 1, ECS Container 2, ECS Container 3, ECS Container 4)\n\n### Harnessing EventBridge for Regional Failover\n\n*(Diagram showing AWS Cloud with a Primary Region and Secondary Region, connected by a Global endpoint, alarm, Route 53 health check, and EventBridge rule with an event bus and consumers)*\n\n### Designing for Resiliency and Recovery\n\n*   **Route 53:** Provides DNS-based load balancing. Provides basic failover between endpoints or S3 websites.\n*   **ELB (Elastic Load Balancing):** Provides traffic distribution. Makes disaster recovery implementation straightforward.\n*   **Amazon VPN:** Provides secure access to your on-premises network resources from your Amazon VPC through a VPN connection.\n*   **AWS Direct Connect:** Provides the dedicated network connection for fast, consistent data transfer between on-premises and AWS.\n\n### Supporting Database Recovery\n\n*   **Amazon RDS:**\n    *   Save a snapshot in a separate Region.\n    *   Use read replicas and Multi-AZ deployments.\n    *   Retain automated backups.\n*   **DynamoDB:**\n    *   Back up entire tables.\n    *   Use point-in-time-recovery to restore tables.\n    *   Create backups.\n    *   Use global tables to build a multi-Region, multi-active database.\n\n### Replicating and Redeploying Environments\n\n*   **CloudFormation:**\n    *   Use templates to quickly deploy collections of resources as needed.\n    *   Duplicate production environments in a new Region or virtual private cloud (VPC) in minutes.\n*   **OpsWorks:** Manage and deploy applications across fleets.\n\n### Key Takeaways: AWS Disaster Recovery Planning\n\n*   Use features such as CRR (Cross-Region Replication), EBS volume snapshots, and Amazon RDS snapshots to protect data.\n*   Use networking features, such as Route 53 failover and ELB, to improve application availability.\n*   Use automation services, such as CloudFormation, as part of your DR strategy to quickly deploy duplicate environments when needed.\n*   Use EventBridge to use global endpoints to automatically restore data and failover to functioning servers.\n\n## 8.

However, it has the highest RTO.\n*   Multi-site provides the fastest RTO. However, it costs the most because it provides a fully running production-ready duplicate.\n*   Storage Gateway provides three interfaces—File Gateway, Volume Gateway, and Tape Gateway—for data backup and recovery between on-premises and the AWS Cloud.\n\n## 9.

As a result, all changes must be compatible with the existing software architecture, design, and code limitations.\\n\\n#### Shorter Time Frame\\nMaintenance activities might last anywhere from a few hours to many months, but software creation can take up to a year.\\n\\n#### Available Test Data\\nTest cases are created from scratch during software development, however software maintenance can choose a portion of these test cases and run them as regression tests. As a result, selecting acceptable test cases from the existing test suite is a hurdle. To effectively test the code changes, in addition to the regression test cases, new test cases must be written.\\n\\n### Intention-Based Classification\\n\\nAccording to ISO\\/IEC 14764, the categories of software maintenance are:\\n\\n#### Corrective Maintenance\\nReact to problems that are uncovered. Unplanned (unscheduled) software maintenance is also required to allow the software to function.\\n\\n#### Adaptive Maintenance\\nMaintain software usability in an ever-changing environment. For example, software modifications may be required as a result of an operating system upgrade.\\n\\n#### Perfective Maintenance\\nThe goal is to increase user experience, processing efficiency, and maintainability, among other things. For a better user experience, the program outputs can be made more understandable; the program can be updated to make it faster, hence enhancing processing efficiency.\\n\\n#### Preventive Maintenance\\nAfter-sales modification of a software product to uncover and remedy fundamental flaws before they become operational flaws. For example, with good programming styles, the impact of change is reduced, thereby reducing the number of failures.\\n\\n### Activity-Based Classification\\n\\nThe intention of an activity depends upon the reason for the change. Two categories: corrections and enhancements.\\n\\n#### Corrections\\nThe activities in this category are intended to correct system flaws, which are defined as a difference between the expected and actual behaviour of the system.\\n\\n|                 | Enhancement | Correction |\\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- |\\n| Proactive       | Perfective  | Preventive |\\n| Reactive        | Adaptive    | Corrective |\\n\\n#### Enhancements\\nDo not necessarily modify the system’s behavior. Categorised into three subcategories as follows:\\n\\n#### Enhancement Type 1\\nEnhancement activities that modify existing requirements (some) implemented by the system\\n\\n#### Enhancement Type 2\\nEnhancement activities that add new system requirements\\n\\n#### Enhancement Type 3\\nEnhancement activities that change the implementation without modifying the existing requirements of the system.\\n\\n|                 | Enhancement | Correction |\\n| :-------------- | :---------- | :--------- |\\n| Proactive       | Perfective  | Preventive |\\n| Reactive        | Adaptive    | Corrective |\\n\\n### Evidence-Based Classification\\n\\n#### Objectives\\n*Based on objective evidence, which may be measured by observations and comparisons of software before and after alterations*\\n*Select the classification coarseness to reflect a true representative mix of observed activities*\\n*Hardware, operating system (OS), organisational processes, design methodology, implementation language, and employees involved in maintenance should all be classified independently of the execution and development environments.*\\n\\n#### Classification of Maintenance Activities\\nThe types of maintenance activities are clustered based on modifications made, detected, or observed on four elements of the system being maintained:\\n\\n#### Entire Software\\nThe entire software\\n\\n#### External Documentation\\nThe external documentation\\n\\n#### Program Code Properties\\nThe properties of the program code\\n\\n#### Customer Experience\\nThe experience of customer on system functionality.\\n\\n### Support Interface\\n\\n#### Training\\nThis refers to informing the stakeholders about the system\'s implementation.\\n\\n#### Consultive\\nIn this type, maintenance work is estimated in terms of cost and time, personnel staff a help desk, clients are assisted in preparing maintenance work requests, and personnel share expert knowledge of available resources and the system with others in the company to improve efficiency.\\n\\n#### Evaluative\\nReviewing the program code and documentations, assessing the ripple effect of a proposed modification, writing and performing tests, examining the programming support offered by the operating system, and discovering and debugging the required data are all common actions in this kind.\\n\\n### Documentation\\n\\n#### Reformative\\nOrdinary actions of this sort include improving the readability of the documentation, aligning it with other system modifications, creating training materials, and adding entries to a data dictionary.\\n\\n#### Updative\\nTypical tasks include replacing out-of-date documentation with current documentation, creating semi-formal documentation, such as in UML, to document current programme code, and updating the documentation with test plans.\\n\\n### Software Properties\\n\\n#### Groomative\\nSubstituting more efficient and simpler components and algorithms, updating data naming standards, changing access authorizations, compiling source code, and performing backups are all common actions in this category. Ordinary preventive efforts of this type make improvements to improve maintainability and lay the groundwork for a future transition to an emerging technology. Performance activities provide results that have an influence on the user. These operations increase system uptime by replacing slower components and algorithms. Ordinary Adaptive actions of this sort migrate software to a new execution platform and increase the use of COTS components.\\n\\n### Business Rules\\n\\n#### Reductive\\nOrdinary operations of this sort reduce the amount of data input to the system and reduce the amount of data created by the system.\\n\\n#### Corrective\\nCorrecting detected flaws, implementing defensive programming strategies, and changing the way exceptions are handled are all common actions in this category.\\n\\n#### Enhancive\\nAdding and changing business rules to improve the system\'s functionality available to the client, as well as adding new data flows into or out of the software, are typical tasks in this category.\\n\\n### Evidence-Based Maintenance Activities\\n\\n### Evidence-Based Classification: Decision Tree-Based Criteria\\n\\n## Issues and Challenges in Software Maintenance\\n\\n### Costs\\nSoftware maintenance is a big part of the overall development process, consuming between 60% and 80% of total costs. Most of these expenses come from making enhancements or updates to the software rather than fixing errors.\\n\\n### Impact Analysis\\nOne major challenge in maintaining software is understanding how changes will affect the rest of the system. Impact analysis helps assess the possible outcomes of a modification, aiming to minimize unexpected problems. This process includes checking if the proposed change is correct, evaluating risks, and estimating how it will impact system performance and development.\\n\\n### Corrective Changes\\nCorrective changes can be tricky because it\'s often hard to identify where exactly changes need to be made in the code. Recognizing the relevant parts of the codebase can be difficult. Even small modifications might require significant changes to the software\'s structure, which can be time-consuming. If a workaround has already been implemented for a problem, fixing new issues can become even more complicated. Repairing design flaws is challenging since it requires a deep understanding of the entire codebase and comes with risks.\\n\\n### Adaptive Changes\\nAdaptive changes, which involve updating the software to work with new technologies, can also be hard. Sometimes, there\'s not enough information about what the software needs to change to. Understanding new technologies and how to integrate them can be difficult. Additionally, issues may arise from a lack of proper initial design.\\n\\n### Program Comprehension\\nProgram comprehension is another important aspect. Maintenance engineers often spend a lot of time reading and understanding the code and documentation to grasp the logic, purpose, and structure of the software. This understanding is crucial for effectively maintaining and improving the quality of the software.\\n\\n## IEEE Maintenance Process (IEEE 1219)\\n\\n*   Problem Identification & Classification\\n*   Request\\n*   Analysis\\n*   Design\\n*   Implementation\\n*   System Test\\n*   Acceptance Test\\n*   Delivery\\n\\n### IEEE Maintenance Process Attributes\\n\\nEach of the seven activities have five associated attributes as follows:\\n\\n#### Activity Definition\\nThis refers to the implementation process of the activity.\\n\\n#### Input\\nThis refers to the items that are required as input to the activity.\\n\\n#### Output\\nThis refers to the items that are produced by the activity.\\n\\n#### Control\\nThis refers to those items that provide control over the activity.\\n\\n#### Metrics\\nThis refers to the items that are measured during the execution of the activity.\\n\\n## ISO\\/IEC 14764 Maintenance Process\\n\\n### ISO\\/IEC 14764 Maintenance Process High-Level Activities\\n\\nThe maintenance process comprises the following high-level activities:\\n\\n1.  Process implementation\\n2.  Problem and modification analysis\\n3.  Modification implementation\\n4.  Maintenance review and acceptance\\n5.  Migration\\n6.  Retirement\\n\\n#### Process Implementation\\n*   Create maintenance processes and strategies.\\n*   Procedures for Modification Requests should be established.\\n*   Put the CM process into action.\\n\\n#### Problem and Modification Analysis\\n*   Perform a preliminary investigation.\\n*   Confirm the issue.\\n*   Create choices for executing the change.\\n*   Keep track of the outcomes.\\n*   Obtain clearance for the option of modification.\\n\\n#### Implement Modification\\n*   Conduct a thorough investigation (analysis).\\n*   The modification should be developed, coded, and tested.\\n\\n#### Maintenance Review and Acceptance\\n*   Conduct evaluations.\\n*   Obtain approval for the change.\\n\\n#### Migration\\n*   Ascertain that the migration is compliant with ISO\\/IEC 12207.\\n*   Make a migration strategy.\\n*   Users should be notified about migration intentions.\\n*   Carry out processes in parallel.\\n*   Notify the user that the transfer has begun.\\n*   Conduct a post-op evaluation.\\n*   Make sure that old data can be accessed.\\n\\n#### Retirement\\n*   Develop a plan for retirement.\\n*   Acknowledge users of retirement plans.\\n*   Parallel operations are conducted.\\n*   Acknowledge user the start of retirement.\\n*   Make sure old data is accessible.\\n\\n## Maintenance Models\\n\\n### Reuse-Oriented Models\\n\\n1.  Quick fix model\\n2.  Iterative enhancement model\\n3.  Full reuse model\\n\\n### Reuse-Oriented Models\\nAssumes that existing components can be re-used in software maintenance. It consists of the following steps:\\n\\n*   Identifying the components of the old system which can be reused\\n*   Understanding these components\\n*   Modifying the old system components so that they can be used in the new system\\n*   Integrating the modified components into the new system.\\n\\n#### Quick Fix Model\\n\\n##### Quick Fix Model Description\\n*   Necessary changes are quickly made to the code and then to the accompanying documentation.\\n*   The new code is recompiled to produce a new version.\\n*   Embodies a commonly used approach to software maintenance.\\n*   Low cost.\\n*   Less concern on the impacts of modifications.\\n\\n#### Iterative Enhancement Model\\n\\n##### Iterative Enhancement Model Description\\n*   Based on the Japanese concept of Kaizen, which stands for the gradual and systematic enhancement of procedures.\\n*   First changes are made to the highest level documents.\\n*   Eventually, changes are propagated down to the code level.\\n*   Assumes complete documentation is available.\\n*   It begins with the existing system’s artifacts, namely, requirements, design, code, test, and analysis documents.\\n*   It revises the highest-level documents affected by the changes and propagates the changes down through the lower-level documents.\\n*   The model allows maintainers to redesign the system, based on the analysis of the existing system.\\n*   Also accommodates the quick fix model.\\n\\nThree stages cycle:\\n\\n*   Analysis of software system.\\n*   Classification of requested modifications.\\n*   Implementation of requested modifications.\\n\\n#### Full Reuse Model\\n*   A new system is built from components of the old system and others available in the repository.\\n*   The main assumption in this model is the availability of a repository of artifacts describing the earlier versions of the present and similar systems.\\n\\n##### Full Reuse Model Activities\\n\\nFull reuse comprises two major steps:\\n\\n1.  Perform requirement analysis and design of the new system.\\n2.  Use the appropriate artifacts, such as requirements, design, code, and test from any earlier versions of the old system.\\n\\nThe following activities are performed:\\n\\n*   Identify the components of the old system that are candidates for reuse.\\n*   Understand the identified system components.\\n*   Modify the old system components to support the new requirements.\\n*   Integrate the modified components to form the newly developed system.\\n\\n### Other Models\\n\\n*   Boehm\'s Model\\n*   Taute Maintenance Model.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1.

Role of a Cloud Architect in Disaster Planning\n\nAs a cloud architect, your primary responsibilities in disaster planning include:\n\n*   **Risk Mitigation and Recovery Design:**\n    *   **Goal:** Design architectures that actively reduce the likelihood of disasters and ensure swift recovery when they occur.\n    *   **Impact:** Minimize the negative effects of disasters on business operations.\n*   **Business Alignment:**\n    *   **Consideration:** Understand and prioritize the organization\'s business requirements.\n    *   **Action:** Select and implement disaster recovery patterns that effectively balance cost, acceptable data loss, and recovery speed.\n\n## 6. Disaster Planning Strategies\n\n### Failures Can Occur at Any Scale\n\n*   **Definition:** Disasters are not limited to large-scale events; they can manifest at various levels of impact.\n*   **Types of Events:**\n    *   **Small-scale events:** Isolated failures, such as a single server becoming unresponsive.\n    *   **Large-scale events:** Affecting multiple resources across an entire Availability Zone (AZ).\n    *   **Global events:** Widespread failures impacting numerous users and systems across broad geographical areas.\n\n### Avoiding and Planning for Disaster\n\n*   **Fault Tolerance:**\n    *   **Definition:** The ability of a system to continue operating, perhaps at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some of its components fail.\n    *   **Goal:** To minimize the frequency of application and data unavailability.\n*   **Backup:**\n    *   **Definition:** The process of creating and storing copies of data or system configurations.\n    *   **Goal:** To ensure that data can be recovered in the event of loss due to a disaster.\n*   **Disaster Recovery (DR):**\n    *   **Definition:** The established plan and processes for restoring data and bringing applications back online after a disruptive event.\n    *   **Goal:** To recover critical operations and data after a disaster has occurred.\n\n### Factors That Influence Disaster Planning Strategies\n\nThe selection and implementation of DR strategies are influenced by several key business considerations:\n\n*   **Time Dependency:**\n    *   **Question:** How quickly must a business process be restored to avoid significant negative impact?\n*   **Data Loss Tolerance:**\n    *   **Question:** What is the maximum amount and type of data loss that the business can accept?\n*   **Geographic Location:**\n    *   **Consideration:** Do disasters affect multiple AWS Regions? Do different Regions have varying RPO/RTO requirements?\n*   **Cost:**\n    *   **Question:** Does the proposed DR solution\'s cost align with the business impact of a disaster and the associated risks?\n\n### Determining RPO (Recovery Point Objective)\n\n*   **Definition:** RPO represents the maximum acceptable duration of data loss after an unplanned data-loss event. It answers the question: \"How much data can we afford to lose?\"\n*   **Measurement:** Measured in time (e.g., minutes, hours, days).\n*   **Practical Implication:** Dictates the frequency of data backups. A lower RPO requires more frequent backups.\n*   **Diagram Interpretation:** Illustrates the time between the last backup and when a disaster strikes, highlighting the RPO as the data lost during that interval.\n\n#### Example: Determining RPO\n\n*   **Scenario:** A business determines that losing up to 800 records is acceptable.\n*   **Analysis:** The application generates approximately 100 records per hour.\n*   **Calculation:** To stay within the acceptable data loss, backups must be performed at least every 8 hours (8 hours \\* 100 records/hour = 800 records).\n*   **Conclusion:** An RPO of 8 hours is deemed acceptable. If a disaster strikes at 10 p.m., data from before 2 p.m. (8 hours prior) should be recoverable.\n\n### Determining RTO (Recovery Time Objective)\n\n*   **Definition:** RTO defines the maximum acceptable downtime for a business process after a disaster occurs. It answers the question: \"How long can our business be offline?\"\n*   **Measurement:** Measured in time (e.g., minutes, hours, days).\n*   **Practical Implication:** Influences the complexity and cost of the DR solution. A lower RTO typically requires a more robust and expensive solution.\n*   **Diagram Interpretation:** Shows the time elapsed from when a disaster strikes until applications and data are fully recovered, with RTO representing this recovery window.\n\n#### Example: Determining RTO\n\n*   **Scenario:** A ticketing service for a music venue needs to be restored within 2 hours.\n*   **Business Impact:** The venue starts losing revenue from unfulfilled sales after 2 hours of outage.\n*   **Conclusion:** An RTO of 2 hours is established as acceptable. If a disaster strikes at 9 p.m., the system must be operational again before 11 p.m.\n\n### Preparing a BCP (Business Continuity Plan)\n\n*   **Definition:** A BCP is a comprehensive framework designed to prevent and recover from potential threats that could disrupt a company\'s operations.\n*   **Key Components:**\n    *   **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** Identifies critical business functions and assesses the impact of disruptions.\n    *   **Risk Assessment:** Evaluates potential threats and vulnerabilities.\n    *   **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Outlines the technical steps to restore IT systems and data.\n    *   **RPO and RTO Determination:** Establishes specific, measurable recovery objectives.\n\n### Key Takeaways: Disaster Planning Strategies\n\n*   **Failure Scope:** Disasters can occur at small, large, or global scales, requiring scalable DR solutions.\n*   **DR Plan Importance:** A well-defined DR plan is crucial for minimizing the negative impact of disruptions on businesses and customers.\n*   **RPO Defined:** Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss after a disaster.\n*   **RTO Defined:** Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum acceptable downtime for applications and systems.\n*   **BCP Integration:** A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) encompasses DR planning, including the definition of RPO and RTO, as a system for preventing and recovering from threats.\n\n## 7.

The maximum acceptable amount of data loss is 7 minutes. The DR solution also requires the deployment of a completely functional version of the applications to handle the majority of traffic immediately, and then scale up to full capacity over time. Which disaster recovery pattern would provide the most cost-effective solution?\n\n**Identify the key words and phrases before continuing:**\n\n*   **Business-critical:** Indicates a high requirement for availability and low tolerance for disruption.\n*   **Functional version of the applications:** Suggests that the DR environment needs to be more than just backups; it needs running components.\n*   **Handle the majority of traffic immediately:** Implies a fast failover capability.\n*   **Cost-effective:** The solution should balance DR needs with budget constraints.\n\n### Sample Exam Question: Response Choices\n\n| Choice | Response         |\n| :----- | :--------------- |\n| A      | Backup and restore |\n| B      | Pilot light      |\n| C      | Warm standby     |\n| D      | Multi-site       |\n\n### Sample Exam Question: Answer\n\nThe answer is **C. Warm standby**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Backup and restore (A):** Has too high an RTO/RPO (hours) for business-critical applications with a 7-minute data loss tolerance.\n*   **Pilot light (B):** While faster than backup/restore, it doesn\'t typically handle the *majority* of traffic *immediately* and might require more scaling than a warm standby.\n*   **Warm standby (C):** This pattern fits the requirements well: it runs a scaled-down but fully functional version of the application, allowing immediate failover for the majority of traffic, and can scale up. It\'s more cost-effective than Multi-site for scenarios that don\'t need instant, full-capacity failover. The RPO/RTO (minutes) is also suitable for a 7-minute data loss requirement.\n*   **Multi-site (D):** Offers the fastest RTO (near real-time) and lowest RPO, but is the most expensive and likely overkill if the goal is \"most cost-effective\" while still meeting the needs.\n\n## 12.
